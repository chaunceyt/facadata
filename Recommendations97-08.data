FOOD SECURITY ADVISORY COMMITTEE
September 19, 2001

	The U.S. Food Security Advisory Committee (FSAC) met on the above date in the expectations that there was to be a meeting of the Interagency Working Group (IWG) shortly thereafter.  That meeting has been cancelled, but the events leading to its cancellation lend added importance to the issue of global food security.

	On September 19th members of the FSAC heard the results of a recently completed study of the U.S. government's follow up to the original World Food Summit.  That study identifies a number of problems with the U.S. follow- up to the Summit.  In addition, the Committee heard the results of a study dedicated to identifying the costs and benefits of food security measures.  The results of these two studies are recommended to the IWG.

	The forthcoming World Food Security Summit + 5 (WFS:5yl, or the 5 years later review of the 1996 Summit) will be a meeting of Heads of State.  The FSAC urges that the U.S. government be represented at this Summit at the highest level.

	The FSAC also believes that the present Administration needs to restate the U.S. commitment to the goals of the Food Security Summit.  Furthermore, the United States government should help keep food security at the top of the agenda of forthcoming international meetings and summits.

	More specific recommendations are as follows:

1. Food security and poverty alleviation are critical dimensions to U.S. national security interests.

2. The events of September 11, 2001 emphasize the importance of the United States playing an active role in alleviating poverty and addressing the food security problem both here and abroad.

3. There is a clear need for leadership from the U.S. government on the food security issue.  That leadership requires that the various components of the U.S. government be brought together in a collaborative endeavor.

4. Civil society has an important role to play in addressing the food security issue, and these efforts need to be integrated with the multi-pronged efforts of the U.S. government. 

5. Domestic food security issues need to be a part of the U.S. response to the food security challenge.  That is the only way this country can be a credible leader on the international scene.

6. Poverty alleviation is a critical part of responding to the food security issue, both domestically and abroad.  However, there are multiple approaches to addressing the food security problem, and all avenues need to be explored.

7. Economic development is the means by which poverty can be alleviated on a broad scale.  The modernization of agriculture is the key to promoting economic development on a broad scale, and needs to be given a higher place on the economic development agenda.

8. International trade plays a dual role in addressing the food security issue.  In the short term it provides the means by which shortfalls in some parts of the world can be addressed with imports from other parts of the world.  In the longer term, international trade can be a critical source of economic growth and development.

9. Food security is a moral issue involving the right to food.  The United States needs to recognize that the right to food is an important issue globally, and is recognized in some individual states.

10. The IWG should give special attention to the report, ""Fulfilling the Promise:  A Governance Analysis of the U.S. Response to the World Food Summit Goal of Cutting Hunger in Half by 2015,"" prepared by Michael Taylor and his colleague, Jody Tick, at the Resources for the Future.  That report has important lessons and implications for this nation's future food security measures.

INSERT INTO Recommendations97_08 (ID, CID, CNo, FY, Recommendation, LegislationRequired, LegislationStatus, Remarks) VALUES (1095,30656,241,"2007","Continue","   ",NULL,"The Board of Visitors does not issue separate reports. The Board provides the government's decision maker its advice and recommendation in its meeting minutes.

The Board's most important role is that of an advisory and independent sounding board, furnishing constructive input to the University leadership and, from its founding, the Board has provided expert guidance on a range of vital academic issues and greatly contributed to the University’s education, outreach and research missions. 

At the same time, the Board serves as a guardian of institutional integrity, assisting the President to ensure the University continues to fulfill its stated mission.  To offer that level of support and challenge, if necessary, the Board must operate independently of the University, while maintaining open communication with both the President of the National Defense University and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

The Board continues to perform the role for which it was originally formed.  Since the establishment of the original Board in 1977, the University has grown considerably.  The Institute for National Strategic Studies (INSS) and the Information Resources Management College (IRMC) were established within NDU in 1984 and 1990 respectively.  In 1997 and 1998, the Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies (CHDS) and the Center for Defense Leadership and Management Program (CDLAMP) became part of NDU.  In 2002 CDLAMP became the School for National Security Executive Education (SNSEE) with Counterterrism Education as its core program. In 2004 the Institute for Homeland Security Studies was established with Homeland Security Education as its core program and the Center for Counterproliferation Research underwent a name change; its new name is ""the Center for Weapons of Mass Destruction; its core mission remains unchanged 

In 1998, under the terms of the Defense Reform Initiative (DRI), the Office of Net Assessment Corporate Fellows Program and the National Security Education Program (NSEP) joined the University.  In 2000, three additional elements were created and joined the University: the Near East-South Asia Center for Strategic Studies, the Africa Center for Strategic Studies, and the Center for Technology and National Security Policy.  The BOV serves all the new University components, as well as the original colleges.

Balanced membership is maintained on the Board.  Members represent a broad spectrum of expertise in government, business and education.  In addition, there is a balance between military and civilian national security practitioners, academicians and civilian leaders in public service and the private sector.

No existing staff or advisory committees can perform the Board's functions.  As in all highly regarded academic institutions, the observations, reviews and criticism of accomplished persons in various disciplines and professional backgrounds outside the faculty structure and government are needed to maintain a viable and forward looking educational program for senior students representing diverse professional backgrounds.

Accordingly, it is highly desirable to have an advisory board whose members have served at the highest levels of policy and decision-making in the Services, Federal Government, academia, and other realms, where they are recognized as top authorities in their field.
In February 1997, upon completion of an extended candidacy process, NDU received notification of accreditation by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.  Accreditation empowers the University to grant masters degrees to its senior college students upon their graduation.  One of the criteria established as a standard for accreditation (contained in the Commission on Higher Education's publication, Characteristics of Excellence in Higher Education) is that a university must have ""a governing board actively fulfilling its responsibilities of policy and resource development.""  In other words, since receiving re-accreditation in 2002, NDU's retention of a governing board, i.e., its Board of Visitors, was no longer discretionary. 

In this report you will see the names of 23 members (actual membership is 21, (4-Ex Offico's and 17-Appointed members)), this is a result of members both departing and new memberships as follows:  General Binford Peay, III USA (Ret)step down as a board member effective upon the expiration of his term of office (8/10/2007, to replace him, Office of White House Liaison approved the appointment of General CarltonFulford, Jr USMC (Ret)to replace General Peay.

The Advisory Committee recommends to the Secretary of Agriculture, that while acknowledging the importance of maintaining individual confidentiality, that NASS be granted access to the National Animal Identification System for the purpose of producing statistical data summaries.   

2.	The Advisory Committee recommends to the Secretary of Agriculture that NASS work in collaboration with other USDA agencies to establish more direct links to agricultural data contained in other USDA websites.

3.	The Advisory Committee recommends to the Secretary of Agriculture that NASS work with the Office of the General Counsel and the Office of the Chief Information Officer, to modify the required “Warning” notification on its Electronic Data Reporting website.  NASS should make the “Warning” notification more user friendly in an effort to ease farmers concerns in reporting electronically.

4.	The Advisory Committee recommends that NASS establish a phone number for to respondents to contact multilingual operators, – especially Spanish for assistance in reporting for the Census of Agriculture.  NASS should also develop questionnaires in other languages, and again especially Spanish.  Also, NASS needs to hire indigenous enumerators to conduct data collection on Indian reservations for the Census of Agriculture. 

5.	The Advisory Committee recommends that a subcommittee consisting of Gene Nelson, Terry Francl, Lucy Meyring, Ron Plain, and Kitty Smith, study the need and feasibility of a National Equine survey.   If the feasibility of conducting a National Equine survey is justified by this subcommittee, it will enhance NASS’s ability to seek appropriation funding. 

6.	The Advisory Committee recommends that NASS conduct more in-depth research concerning the new question on the Census of Agriculture asking for data on the acres operated on an Animal Unit Month (AUM).  The current members felt that the wording of the AUM question might be misunderstood by operators and result in misreported data. (This same AUM question has also been added to the Agricultural Resources Management Survey ARMS)

7.	The Advisory Committee recommends that a subcommittee consisting of Terry Francl, Frank Howell, Doris Mold, Janice Gengenbach, and Kent Schescke to research the feasibility of conducting an Energy survey.  With the raising cost of energy and the increased use of crops to generate new alternative fuels, the committee felt that the importance of this survey would be of more importance than an organic follow-on survey. 

8.	The Advisory Subcommittee on Pesticide Data Usage, after meeting and studying the scope of the NASS pesticide and chemical use program, recommended that no changes to the current NASS program are advised at this time and that the subcommittee be discontinued.  

9.	The Advisory Committee recommends that the priority needs for the 2007 Census of Agriculture follow-on surveys are 1) Census of Horticulture; 2) Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey; and 3) Economics and Land Ownership Survey.  

10.	The Advisory Committee recommends that NASS request that the Government Printing Office add the Census of Agriculture to the “Essential Titles for Public Use in Paper Format”, to ensure this media is available to all federal depository and research libraries.  

11.	The Advisory Committee recommends that NASS continue its efforts in working with Community Based Organizations and with the New Mexico pilot project on Indian reservations, to improve overall coverage of small and minority operated farms in the 2007 Census of Agriculture.

12.	The Advisory Committee recommends that NASS consider the use of outside promotional consultants and external support endorsements in development of the 2007 Census of Agriculture campaign to encourage producer cooperation.");

The NGRAC, a statutory committee, was established in March 1992, under the USDA Departmental Regulation 1043-8 as directed by Section 1632 of P.L. 101-624 of the 1990 Farm Bill. Its charter was last renewed in March 1999 and expired in March 2001.  The NGRAC is appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture, and its duties are solely advisory to the Secretary and the Director of the National Genetic Resources Program (NGRP) on matters concerning the NGRP, established by the U.S. Congress to: acquire, characterize, preserve, document, and distribute to scientists germplasm of all life forms important for food and agricultural production. The NGRAC responds to the important issues of the nation in respect to conserving and utilizing genetic resources for food and agriculture. It meets twice a year, and can consist of up to nine members appointed by the Secretary and seven or more ex-officio members. Two-thirds of the appointed members represent the scientific disciplines relevant to NGRP, and one-third represent the general public in relevant activities. Thus, it is likely that each of the life forms in NGRP (plants, forest species, animals, aquatics, insects, and microbes) is represented by only one appointed scientific member.  The most recent meeting of the NGRAC was in August 1999 in Washington, D.C.Five new members were newly appointed in September 2000. The NGRAC’s most recent recommendations to the Department and the Program are included on its web page at http://www.ars-grin.gov/ngrac/

Currently, the NGRAC is inactive, pending rechartering.  New members must be appointed, or current members reappointed.  It would meet at least once, and perhaps twice, in 2004, likely in the mid-late spring, and early autumn. The agenda for such meeting would, of course, be strongly determined by the chair and members, but the following issue would likely merit high priority for discussion: 1) international genetic resource treaties and agreements, e.g., the International Treaty for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture; 2) review of USDA’s progress with acting on the previous NGRAC recommendation to the USDA and the NGRP to develop a road map (more explicit in relevant content than the broad Agricultural Research Service Six-Year Plan) and strategic plan for its genetic resources and genomics programs; 3) review of activities of other Advisory Committees, in particular those that deal with genetic resources, such as the ones on Agricultural Biotechnology and Invasive Species; 4) review of current budgets and fiscal status of USDA genetic resource programs; 5) review recent domestic and international developments associated with the application of intellectual property rights protection to plant genetic resources.");

Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee
2001-2007
Complete List of Recommendations and Statements (organized by Working Group)

PACA, Inspection Service and Market News:

Recommendation: The produce industry and the Market News Service should work together to educate industry members of the importance of providing accurate price and shipment information to the Market News Service.  This educational effort should include information on the process, how information is gathered, how the information is used, and the potential ramifications of inaccurate reports. (April 2003)

Recommendation: The PACA and the Inspection Service should develop a long-range plan to review and re-evaluate the Grade Standards for perishable agricultural commodities.  The process should involve members from all segments of the produce industry.  The review and possible revision of U.S. standards is necessary to incorporate modern industry practices and terminologies. (April 2003)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends that software and computer systems used by USDA and various state agencies to administer the Federal-State Inspection Program are compatible to increase efficiencies and decrease costs. (April 2002)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recognizes the value of the destination market inspection service. (April 2002)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee would like to commend AMS Fruit and Vegetable Programs for their quick progress on developing and implementing a long-range plan to review and re-evaluate U.S. grade standards for perishable agricultural commodities. (February 2004)

Recommendation: USDA should seek to educate the industry as to what is meant by the USDA grade stamp.  USDA should discourage the representation of anything more than what it represents. (July 2004)

Recommendation: Mindful that an effective Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA) is critical to the fruit and vegetable industry, the Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends the following changes to the PACA:

•	Consolidate license functions to one location; reduce field offices to three locations;
•	Evaluate development of a national call center as an industry resource;
•	Evaluate increasing the filing fee for informal and formal complaints;
•	Increase industry outreach and web resources; and
•	Evaluate the inclusion of a processing fee for single-year license renewals. (July 2004)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee strongly recommends a multiyear approach to addressing the revenue/cost gap that exists in the Fresh Products Branch’s terminal market inspection program, to recognize the impact on demand for services that significant price increases could have.  We commend recent and encourage future initiatives to hold down and reduce costs while maintaining the level of quality service needed by our industry. (July 2005)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends that the Department of Agriculture amend Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act regulations for the purpose of implementing a fee structure associated with industry members requesting PACA audits in connection with reparation complaints.  We propose that licensees pay $1,000 and non-licensees pay $3,000 per audit. (January 2007)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends to the Secretary of Agriculture that PACA license fees be raised in Fiscal Year 2010 so that the PACA Trust Fund will not fall below 25 percent of the program’s budget obligations before 2012. (January 2007)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends to the Secretary of Agriculture that PACA complaint filing fees be raised to $100 for informal complaints and $500 for formal complaints. (January 2007)

Farm Bill:

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee commends Secretary Johanns for his strong support of the fruit and vegetable industry.  The Committee further urges the Department’s support for provisions in the next Farm Bill that increase demand for fruits and vegetables, improve the health of Americans, and enhance the competitiveness of fruit and vegetable producers. (June 2006)

Recommendation: Recognizing the significant contributions the specialty crop industry makes to the American diet, U.S. agriculture, and the economies of the states in which they are produced, the Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee believes fruit and vegetable growers should receive equitable treatment in federal farm programs.  Accordingly, the Committee commends Secretary Johanns for his strong support of the fruit and vegetable industry and notes with interest the specific recommendations relating to specialty crops contained in USDA’s 2007 Farm Bill Proposals.  In addition to the Department’s recommendations, the Committee recommends that USDA consider the following:

•	Support the provisions of the EAT Healthy America Act (HR 1600) and the Specialty Crops Competition Act of 2007 (S 1160), which provide needed assistance to fruit and vegetable producers in critical areas such as conservation, international trade, pests and disease, nutrition, research, block grants to states, and renewable energy; and

•	Reconsider its position advocating the elimination of the fruit and vegetable planting restriction on program crop acres.  The removal of this important provision would place unsubsidized fruit and vegetable producers at a competitive disadvantage to subsidized program crop producers. (June 2007)

Domestic Fruit and Vegetable Nutrition, Consumption and Distribution:

Recommendation: We recommend that USDA define the current distribution channels for fresh fruits and vegetables and develop, in complete detail, the optimum scenario for delivering fresh fruits and vegetables to schools with the highest quality, maximum efficiency and cost effectiveness.

	AMS/State warehouses
	Department of Defense
	Fresh Local Level Direct Purchasing (April 2003)

Recommendation: We ask USDA to break down each of these three distribution models in a way that all costs of the supply chain are identified. Once completed, we ask USDA to present this information to the Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee, thus allowing the Committee to review and provide recommendations in regards to improving models. (April 2003)

Recommendation: We recommend USDA communicate and celebrate an educational program which promotes successful local school food service programs encompassing fresh fruit and vegetable offerings like the Best Practices program and less reliance on competitive foods. The three areas that define success:

	Better nutrition
	Cost effectiveness, self sufficient food service programs
	More fruit and vegetable offerings overall (April 2003)

Recommendation: We encourage USDA to review current allocations of funds to effectively provide the ultimate objective of increasing of fresh fruits and vegetables in schools, and expanding the four-state pilot program. (April 2003)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee strongly recommends USDA promote the increased consumption of fruits and vegetables as a method to achieve good eating habits and to help facilitate the fight against obesity/malnutrition in the United States. (April 2002)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends that the appropriations of USDA be reallocated to more closely mirror the value of fruits and vegetables and their role in the health of the American consumer. (April 2002)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee encourages the formulation of a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Education that would initiate a curriculum including exercise and complete nutrition information about the benefits of eating fruits and vegetables. (April 2002)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends that USDA continue existing programs and develop additional initiatives that will focus on increasing consumption of all fruits and vegetables in recognition of the tremendous health benefits that a daily diet, which includes five to ten servings of highly nutritious fruit and vegetables, provides.  USDA and other federal agencies should collaborate in programs that will increase fruit and vegetable consumption to help combat chronic diseases, including obesity. (February 2004)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee supports the continuation of programs promoting consumption of all fruits and vegetables.  We urge USDA to continue the Fresh Pilot Program. (February 2004)

Recommendation: USDA should develop a centralized means to communicate via a smooth delivery system scientifically sound nutritional information from the various sources used to develop the Dietary Guidelines.  The focus should be on the importance of education as the key to promoting increased consumption of fruits and vegetables to fight obesity and promote healthy living. (July 2004)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee strongly recommends that USDA follow the Dietary Guidelines in its education and implementation of nutrition assistance programs, such as school lunch, school breakfast, food stamps, and Women, Infants and Children (WIC). (June 2006)

Trade and Country of Origin:

Recommendation: USDA should be more specific in defining Country of Origin Labeling rules pertaining to the U.S. produce industry’s mandatory adherence to documentation requirements and violations; utilize familiar PACA rules to define Country of Origin Labeling requirements; and publish proposed final regulations in the Federal Register as soon as possible. (April 2003)

Recommendation: USDA should issue an opinion on the preservation of trust fund rights available under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA) of 1930 pertaining to electronic invoicing and a statement that USDA is in fact fulfilling buyers obligations in trust protection. (April 2003)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends that USDA, AMS continue its harmonization work with its counterparts in North America through the appropriate mechanism.  The immediate focus should be on implementing the following five harmonization initiatives which are essential elements of establishing a more positive business environment for produce trade across North America:

•	Development and implementation of a new destination market inspection service that builds on the USDA model in Canada;
•	Modernizing the licensing and arbitration regulations under the Canada Agriculture Products Act;
•	Development of an industry-lead strategy to reduce costly and disruptive practices in major markets in Canada;
•	Harmonization of Canadian and U.S. grade standards and inspection procedures; and
•	Development of a Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act-like trust in Canada. (January 2005)

Labor, Immigration and Crop Insurance:

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee acknowledges the importance of agricultural labor in the production and distribution of agricultural commodities.  We would strongly support legislation that would provide a legal labor force for agricultural producers, including, but not limited to, immigration and H2A reform.  We also recognize the importance of the farmworker in our industry. (February 2004)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recognizes that federal crop insurance needs to offer products that have fair and equitable access to all farmers.  The Committee encourages the review of pilot programs to ensure that they do not create unequal opportunities within a commodity region. (July 2005)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee reaffirms the importance of agricultural labor in the production and distribution of agricultural commodities.  We would strongly support legislation that would provide a legal labor force for agricultural producers, including, but not limited to, immigration and H2A reform.  We also recognize the importance of the farmworker in our industry. (January 2007)

Food Safety, Third-Party Audits, Microbiological and Traceability:

Recommendation: USDA should either:

A. Increase funding of the Microbiological Data Program to generate information that will be useful in risk assessment to meet public health objectives; or
B. If the project can not be funded to meet the objectives, USDA should not appropriate additional funds beyond the 2003 fiscal year; or
C. Because data generated to date are inconclusive. USDA should not release findings until data from multiple years are accumulated and analyzed to draw conclusions. (April 2003)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee would like USDA to be a stronger advocate with other federal agencies in the development of science, outcome based regulations when proposed regulations are putting the U.S. fruit and vegetable industry at a competitive disadvantage.  Examples: the Environmental Protection Agency; the Department of Labor; the Food and Drug Administration; the Immigration and Naturalization Service; and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. (April 2002)

After the second plenary meeting, three ad hoc working groups were established to develop information for the committee on future issues and concerns relating to three classes of biotechnology-derived products:   Group I-- crop (and transgenic terrestrial livestock animal) improvements; Group II-- quality improvements; and crop (and transgenic terrestrial livestock animal) specialty products.  The group members are:
Group I: Richard Crowder, Randal Giroux, Duane Grant, David Hoisington, Greg Jaffe, Keith Triebwasser, Lisa Zannoni.
Group II: Terry Medley, Margaret Mellon, Ronald Olson, Jerome Slocum.
Group III: Daryl Buss, Leon Corzine, Carole Cramer, Michael Dykes, Juan Enriquez-Cabot, Randal Giroux, David Magnus.

Following the December, 2003 plenary session, Work Groups were reorganized, with the following 3 new drafting groups:

Issues (that may arise over the next decade, for the 5-to-10 year perspective report):  Daryl Buss, Duane Grant, Michael Dykes, Greg Jaffe, Carole Cramer.

Scenarios for the future (for the 5-to-10 year perspective report):  Juan Enriquez, Jerry Slocum, Margaret Mellon, Terry Medley, Keith Triebwasser, Dave Hoisington.

A separate Traceability and Labeling Report:  Ron Olson, Randall Giroux, Greg Jaffe, Leon Corzine, Lisa Zannoni, Richard Crowder.


Work groups are open-ended, and any additional committee members may particiapte in work group discussions at their discretion.  Groups will meet in closed session via conference calls between plenary sessions, but all materials generated in those calls will be brought to plenary sessions for public discussion.

After her appointment to the AC21 in February, 2004, Carole Tucker Foreman joined the Issues Work Group.

Following the September, 2004, AC21 plenary session, the Issues Work Group was expanded to include all the members of the Traceability and Labeling Report group as well (that group continued to work on its other report also).

Two additional drafting Work Groups were also established at that time:

Definitions (for the 5-to-10 year perspective report):  Terry Medley, Carole Cramer, Randall Giroux

Introduction (for the 5-to-10 year perspective report):  Margaret Mellon, Richard Crowder, Michael Dykes, David Hoisington, Lisa Zannoni.

Please note that the AC21 decided at its February, 2005 meeting to turn the ""Scenarios"" chapter into a separate report (as part of the overall 5-to-10 year perspective charge to the committee) which was entitled, ""Preparing for the Future"" and which was submitted to the Secretary of Agriculture on May 9, 2005.

Following the August 9-10, 2005 plenary session, at which time members agreed to a significantly restructured format for the 5-to-10 year perspective report, existing work groups were viewed as no longer needed for completing the paper.  The committee was, however, divided into 3 (open-ended) groups who would meet via conference call for the purpose of drafting text on new topics discussed by the committee or reviewing Chair's draft text for the introductory portions (formal introduction plus the section on ""Realizing the Promise:  Opportunities and Challenges"") of the report.  The three groups were:  ""New Issues #1"": Michael Dykes, Robert Herdt, Ronald Olson, Margaret Mellon, Leon Corzine, Russell Kremer; ""New Topics #2"": Carol Tucker Foreman, Lisa Zannoni, Josephine Hunt, Duane Grant, Richard Crowder, Alison Van Eenennaam;  ""Introduction"":  Daryl Buss, Jerome Slocum, Gregory Jaffe, Bradley Shurdut, Randal Giroux, Carole Cramer,
Patricia Layton.

Following the 12th plenary session and with the substantial completion of another consensus report, a new work group was established to begin to help frame the committee's next project on the impacts of biotechnology coexistence considerations on agriculture and USDA for discussion by the full committee. (All previous work groups were no longer in existence). Members selected for this open-ended work group were Josephine Hunt, Leon Corzine, Michael Dykes, Russ Kremer, Mardi Mellon, and Nicholas Kalaitzandonakes.");

But energy is a complex subject, touching every part of daily life and the overall economy, involving a wide variety of technologies, and deeply affecting many aspects of our foreign relations. The United States is the largest participant in the global energy system — the largest consumer, the second largest producer of coal and natural gas, and the largest importer and third largest producer of oil.

With the close advice and support of the Committee, the Department of State continues to work out with the CIA, NSC, and other agencies new procedures for expanding the Foreign Relations series to include previously highly-classified and sensitive intelligence documentation. These procedures go far to ensuring the full implementation of the statutory mandate to publish a Foreign Relations series that is ""complete and accurate.""

Section V.d. of the Council's Charter requires that the Council report to the Department of State's Under Secretary for Management through the Council's Executive Secretary and specifies that the reporting method may be ""oral and/or written"".  The Council complies with this requirement through briefings on Council activities, issues, and recommendations, which the Executive Secretary provides approximately once a month  to the Department's Assistant Secretary for Administration.  The Assistant Secretary in turn reports the substance of these briefings to the Under Secretary for Management.  In addition, the Executive Secretary provides brief written summaries on each Council Annual and Executive Committee Meeting and other significant activities for inclusion in the Bureau of Administration's  Weekly Activity Report,which the Bureau provides to the Under Secretary for Management.  For example, the Executive Secretary submitted written reports on the participation of two American overseas schools in the Johnson & Johnson-sponsored summer training institute on drug & alcohol abuse prevention at Rutgers University in July 2007 and OSAC's update of the Emergency Procedures Manual for American overseas schools that includes information on preparing for pandemics such as Avian flu.  The Council had  distributed the manual to American overseas schools and to U.S. diplomatic posts in 2003, posted it on the Department’s Intranet at http://aopros.a.state.gov, updatd it in 2006, and is updating and reissuing it in 2007 to provide information on dealing with terrorism and trauma. 

In January 2006, the Executive Secretary, the Council Chair and several other members, and the Acting Assistant Secretary for Administration met with the Under Secretary for Management to discuss ways that the Council could work more closely with the Department to maintain the high quality of American overseas schools.  The Under Secretary committed her office to supporting the Council's work fully and indicated that she would sponsor a meeting with U.S.corporate leaders to obtain their support for the Council's program.  The Council is standing by in 2007 for further direction from the Under Secretary's office on this initiative.  Also as a result of this meeting, the Assistant Secretary for Administration wrote letters to 100 CEOs of U.S. corporations requesting their support for the Council's 2006 Educational Assistance Program to assist American overseas schools.  

Item 18 Costs.  The differences between the cost estimates in this annual report and the cost estimate in the annual report for 2006 reflects the Federal cost of living and locality adjustments provided to FTE and similar cost of living adjustments provided to contractor personnel, which support the Council.

While the Council has no subcommittees per se, it does have an Evaluation Committee, composed of four members that the Council Chair appoints.  The membership of the Evaluation Committee includes the Council Chair, at least one of the Vice Chairs, and two other Council members.  The Evaluation Committee reviews educational improvement/enhancement proposals for American overseas schools, which the Overseas Schools Regional Associations submit for Council sponsorship.  After completing these reviews, the Evaluation Committee makes recommendations on the proposals to the full Council for consideration.  The full Council then accepts, rejects, modifies, or defers  the Evaluation Committee's recommendations.  In addition the Council has established an ad-hoc committee on fundraising.  The Fundraising Committee has considered a variety of ways to improve the Council's fundraising efforts that support its annual Educational Assistance Program.");

After a series of meetings between NSF, EPA, OMB and the Congress, Congress did not take OMB's recommendation to move the funding to NSF and restored full funding to EPA.  However, the funding was to come from EPA's budget and was not monies added into EPA's budget.  All of this caused a delay in getting funding for the office.  Because of these actions, senior management declined to allow the Council to meet and to replace members whose appointments had terminated. In June, 2003, EPA advertised for individuals to replace those members whose appointments have terminated--6 slots.  To date, the new members have not yet been appointed, but should be appointed by the end of the calendar year.  A meeting at the beginning of the next calendar year is anticipated at which time the Council will finish the Report to Congress II and publish its second set of white papers on relevant environmental education issues.

1) Building Capacity
• Create a competitive interdisciplinary graduate and post-graduate training program that
develops cohorts of students trained to address complex forest issues. We recommend
an allocation of $3 million per year that could support ten institutional awards nationwide.
2) Research Initiatives
• Complete a large-scale genome sequencing project for the major U.S. commodity conifer,
Pinus taeda (Loblolly pine), over a period of five years.
• Develop a national forestry research program in the emerging technologies of nanotechnology
and biorefining. These technologies are critical to enhancing the global competitiveness
and energy security of the United States.
3) Efficiency and Effectiveness
• Develop a joint, annual review of Forest Service Research & Development and Cooperative
State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES) programs. The purpose of this
review would be to develop a coherent forest research portfolio that most efficiently addresses
America's forest research priorities.
• Competitive grants for forestry research are dispersed among several National Research
Initiative Competitive Grants Program (NRI) areas, resulting in a fragmented and
under-funded portfolio. Create a separate NRI panel that coordinates projects that relate to
forestry and forest ecosystems, including forest products (equivalent to $30 million).
The description of NRI programs should explicitly identify forest resources as it does for
agriculture, along with “sustaining the quality and productivity of the natural resources”
as now stated.
• Streamline USDA management of forest bioenergy and biobased products research by
designating one authoritative USDA program manager.
• Establish a joint task force drawing from Forest Service, CSREES, and partners to develop
new models for effective and timely delivery of research information to stakeholders
of forestry research.");

Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee
2001-2006
Complete List of Recommendations and Statements (organized by Working Group)

PACA, Inspection Service and Market News:

Recommendation: The produce industry and the Market News Service should work together to educate industry members of the importance of providing accurate price and shipment information to the Market News Service. This educational effort should include information on the process, how information is gathered, how the information is used, and the potential ramifications of inaccurate reports. (April 2003)

Recommendation: The PACA and the Inspection Service should develop a long-range plan to review and re-evaluate the Grade Standards for perishable agricultural commodities. The process should involve members from all segments of the produce industry. The review and possible revision of U.S. standards is necessary to incorporate modern industry practices and terminologies. (April 2003)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends that software and computer systems used by USDA and various state agencies to administer the Federal-State Inspection Program are compatible to increase efficiencies and decrease costs. (April 2002)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recognizes the value of the destination market inspection service. (April 2002)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee would like to commend AMS Fruit and Vegetable Programs for their quick progress on developing and implementing a long-range plan to review and re-evaluate U.S. grade standards for perishable agricultural commodities. (February 2004)

Recommendation: USDA should seek to educate the industry as to what is meant by the USDA grade stamp.  USDA should discourage the representation of anything more than what it represents. (July 2004)

Recommendation: Mindful that an effective Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA) is critical to the fruit and vegetable industry, the Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends the following changes to the PACA:

•	Consolidate license functions to one location; reduce field offices to three locations;
•	Evaluate development of a national call center as an industry resource;
•	Evaluate increasing the filing fee for informal and formal complaints;
•	Increase industry outreach and web resources; and
•	Evaluate the inclusion of a processing fee for single-year license renewals. (July 2004)
Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee strongly recommends a multiyear approach to addressing the revenue/cost gap that exists in the Fresh Products Branch's terminal market inspection program, to recognize the impact on demand for services that significant price increases could have.  We commend recent and encourage future initiatives to hold down and reduce costs while maintaining the level of quality service needed by our industry. (July 2005)

Farm Bill:

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee commends Secretary Johanns for his strong support of the fruit and vegetable industry.  The Committee further urges the Department’s support for provisions in the next Farm Bill that increase demand for fruits and vegetables, improve the health of Americans, and enhance the competitiveness of fruit and vegetable producers. (June 2006)

Domestic Fruit and Vegetable Nutrition, Consumption and Distribution:

Recommendation: We recommend that USDA define the current distribution channels for fresh fruits and vegetables and develop, in complete detail, the optimum scenario for delivering fresh fruits and vegetables to schools with the highest quality, maximum efficiency and cost effectiveness.

	AMS/State warehouses
	Department of Defense
	Fresh Local Level Direct Purchasing (April 2003)

Recommendation: We ask USDA to break down each of these three distribution models in a way that all costs of the supply chain are identified. Once completed, we ask USDA to present this information to the Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee, thus allowing the Committee to review and provide recommendations in regards to improving models. (April 2003)

Recommendation: We recommend USDA communicate and celebrate an educational program which promotes successful local school food service programs encompassing fresh fruit and vegetable offerings like the Best Practices program and less reliance on competitive foods. The three areas that define success:

	Better nutrition
	Cost effectiveness, self sufficient food service programs
	More fruit and vegetable offerings overall (April 2003)

Recommendation: We encourage USDA to review current allocations of funds to effectively provide the ultimate objective of increasing of fresh fruits and vegetables in schools, and expanding the four-state pilot program. (April 2003)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee strongly recommends USDA promote the increased consumption of fruits and vegetables as a method to achieve good eating habits and to help facilitate the fight against obesity/malnutrition in the United States. (April 2002)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends that the appropriations of USDA be reallocated to more closely mirror the value of fruits and vegetables and their role in the health of the American consumer. (April 2002)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee encourages the formulation of a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Education that would initiate a curriculum including exercise and complete nutrition information about the benefits of eating fruits and vegetables. (April 2002)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee applauds USDA for finalizing the Memorandum of Understanding related to and becoming an active participant in the 5-A-Day For Better Health Campaign. (April 2002)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee advocates a closer working relationship with the appropriate state agencies that would facilitate the effective deliveries of USDA-purchased fresh fruits and vegetables through state warehouses to food recipients. This could include pilot projects. (April 2002)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee supports the reconciliation of U.S.-Canada differences related to the use of the 5-A-Day For Better Health Program logo. (April 2002)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee would like USDA to supplement the Food Stamp Program with an incentive mechanism that would allow eligible persons to buy additional fruits and vegetables. (April 2002)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee urges the study of more efficient distribution systems for USDA commodity purchase programs. (February 2004)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends that USDA continue existing programs and develop additional initiatives that will focus on increasing consumption of all fruits and vegetables in recognition of the tremendous health benefits that a daily diet, which includes five to ten servings of highly nutritious fruit and vegetables, provides.  USDA and other federal agencies should collaborate in programs that will increase fruit and vegetable consumption to help combat chronic diseases, including obesity. (February 2004)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee supports the continuation of programs promoting consumption of all fruits and vegetables.  We urge USDA to continue the Fresh Pilot Program. (February 2004)

Recommendation: USDA should develop a centralized means to communicate via a smooth delivery system scientifically sound nutritional information from the various sources used to develop the Dietary Guidelines.  The focus should be on the importance of education as the key to promoting increased consumption of fruits and vegetables to fight obesity and promote healthy living. (July 2004)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee strongly encourages the enhancement of the USDA purchase programs with incentives to include more fruits and vegetables. (July 2004)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee commends USDA for the successful introduction of new dietary guidelines and encourages USDA to continue an ongoing publicity campaign to ensure continued awareness. (July 2005)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee strongly supports the addition of fruits and vegetables to Women, Infants and Children (WIC) food packages and commends USDA for addressing the need for change.  The Committee encourages continued nutrition education (i.e. MyPyramid.gov) as part of the program. (July 2005)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee strongly recommends that USDA follow the Dietary Guidelines in its education and implementation of nutrition assistance programs, such as school lunch, school breakfast, food stamps, and Women, Infants and Children (WIC). (June 2006)

Trade and Country of Origin:

Recommendation: USDA should be more specific in defining Country of Origin Labeling rules pertaining to the U.S. produce industry’s mandatory adherence to documentation requirements and violations; utilize familiar PACA rules to define Country of Origin Labeling requirements; and publish proposed final regulations in the Federal Register as soon as possible. (April 2003)

Recommendation: USDA should issue an opinion on the preservation of trust fund rights available under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA) of 1930 pertaining to electronic invoicing and a statement that USDA is in fact fulfilling buyers obligations in trust protection. (April 2003)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends that USDA, AMS continue its harmonization work with its counterparts in North America through the appropriate mechanism.  The immediate focus should be on implementing the following five harmonization initiatives which are essential elements of establishing a more positive business environment for produce trade across North America:

•	Development and implementation of a new destination market inspection service that builds on the USDA model in Canada;
•	Modernizing the licensing and arbitration regulations under the Canada Agriculture Products Act;
•	Development of an industry-lead strategy to reduce costly and disruptive practices in major markets in Canada;
•	Harmonization of Canadian and U.S. grade standards and inspection procedures; and
•	Development of a Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act-like trust in Canada. (January 2005)

Labor, Immigration and Crop Insurance:

Recommendation: The Secretary should send a letter to the White House endorsing the reform of H2A, the temporary foreign agricultural worker program, as proposed by Senator Craig and supported by the National Council of Agricultural Employers, and the earned adjustment status for the current agricultural workforce. (April 2003)

Recommendation: USDA is urged to fill the critically important position of special assistant for labor affairs with an expert in labor affairs. (April 2003)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee acknowledges the importance of agricultural labor in the production and distribution of agricultural commodities.  We would strongly support legislation that would provide a legal labor force for agricultural producers, including, but not limited to, immigration and H2A reform.  We also recognize the importance of the farmworker in our industry. (February 2004)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recognizes that federal crop insurance needs to offer products that have fair and equitable access to all farmers.  The Committee encourages the review of pilot programs to ensure that they do not create unequal opportunities within a commodity region. (July 2005)

Food Safety, Third-Party Audits, Microbiological and Traceability:

Recommendation: USDA should either:

A. Increase funding of the Microbiological Data Program to generate information that will be useful in risk assessment to meet public health objectives; or
B. If the project can not be funded to meet the objectives, USDA should not appropriate additional funds beyond the 2003 fiscal year; or
C. Because data generated to date are inconclusive. USDA should not release findings until data from multiple years are accumulated and analyzed to draw conclusions. (April 2003)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee would like USDA to be a stronger advocate with other federal agencies in the development of science, outcome based regulations when proposed regulations are putting the U.S. fruit and vegetable industry at a competitive disadvantage. Examples: the Environmental Protection Agency; the Department of Labor; the Food and Drug Administration; the Immigration and Naturalization Service; and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. (April 2002)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee has concerns about USDA’s Microbiological Data Program (MDP) in its current form and questions:

	1) the objective of the MDP;
	2) how the information could be misunderstood/misused;
	3) the risk basis for choosing produce items; and
	4) the validity of the process of sampling and collecting. (April 2002)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends that future USDA research clearly address the impact on each segment of the supply and marketing chain, beginning with the grower. (April 2002)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee strongly encourages the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's Plant Protection and Quarantine to increase its interaction with the produce industry, and to develop proactive communication channels through state and national produce trade associations, emphasizing the importance of early detection and communication to the industry of threats in advance of reaching quarantine levels. (July 2005)

Organic:

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends that USDA work to drive its organic program towards the education of consumers.  The relationship between the organic industry and the USDA should remain focused on using industry knowledge and USDA resources to build consumer confidence through strengthening the integrity of the National Organic Program.  The NOP needs to protect the integrity and values of the organic industry and its consumers by continuing its efforts to bring clarity to the federal rules. (January 2005)

Marketing Orders:

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee, while recognizing the historical value of marketing orders, encourages USDA to explore and ensure that protocols within orders are in place that will provide for transparency in innovation, a streamlined grievance process, and that orders are responsive to the demands and needs of consumers. (July 2005)

Miscellaneous Topics:

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends that USDA continue to communicate support of the critical use exemption process concerning Methyl Bromide, which is written within the Montreal Protocol.  We recommend that concerns about economic impact to farms be kept at the highest level of priority when working within the decision and negotiation process.  We recommend to continue high involvement with the negotiating parties by providing real U.S. farm impacts.  We recommend voicing a concern to streamline this process to make this phase out a controlled and workable process, based on sound verifiable science. (February 2");

After the second plenary meeting, three ad hoc working groups were established to develop information for the committee on future issues and concerns relating to three classes of biotechnology-derived products:   Group I-- crop (and transgenic terrestrial livestock animal) improvements; Group II-- quality improvements; and crop (and transgenic terrestrial livestock animal) specialty products.  The group members are:
Group I: Richard Crowder, Randal Giroux, Duane Grant, David Hoisington, Greg Jaffe, Keith Triebwasser, Lisa Zannoni.
Group II: Terry Medley, Margaret Mellon, Ronald Olson, Jerome Slocum.
Group III: Daryl Buss, Leon Corzine, Carole Cramer, Michael Dykes, Juan Enriquez-Cabot, Randal Giroux, David Magnus.

Following the December, 2003 plenary session, Work Groups were reorganized, with the following 3 new drafting groups:

Issues (that may arise over the next decade, for the 5-to-10 year perspective report):  Daryl Buss, Duane Grant, Michael Dykes, Greg Jaffe, Carole Cramer.

Scenarios for the future (for the 5-to-10 year perspective report):  Juan Enriquez, Jerry Slocum, Margaret Mellon, Terry Medley, Keith Triebwasser, Dave Hoisington.

A separate Traceability and Labeling Report:  Ron Olson, Randall Giroux, Greg Jaffe, Leon Corzine, Lisa Zannoni, Richard Crowder.


Work groups are open-ended, and any additional committee members may particiapte in work group discussions at their discretion.  Groups will meet in closed session via conference calls between plenary sessions, but all materials generated in those calls will be brought to plenary sessions for public discussion.

After her appointment to the AC21 in February, 2004, Carole Tucker Foreman joined the Issues Work Group.

Following the September, 2004, AC21 plenary session, the Issues Work Group was expanded to include all the members of the Traceability and Labeling Report group as well (that group continued to work on its other report also).

Two additional drafting Work Groups were also established at that time:

Definitions (for the 5-to-10 year perspective report):  Terry Medley, Carole Cramer, Randall Giroux

Introduction (for the 5-to-10 year perspective report):  Margaret Mellon, Richard Crowder, Michael Dykes, David Hoisington, Lisa Zannoni.

Please note that the AC21 decided at its February, 2005 meeting to turn the ""Scenarios"" chapter into a separate report (as part of the overall 5-to-10 year perspective charge to the committee) which was entitled, ""Preparing for the Future"" and which was submitted to the Secretary of Agriculture on May 9, 2005.

Following the August 9-10, 2005 plenary session, at which time members agreed to a significantly restructured format for the 5-to-10 year perspective report, existing work groups were viewed as no longer needed for completing the paper.  The committee was, however, divided into 3 (open-ended) groups who would meet via conference call for the purpose of drafting text on new topics discussed by the committee or reviewing Chair's draft text for the introductory portions (formal introduction plus the section on ""Realizing the Promise:  Opportunities and Challenges"") of the report.  The three groups were:  ""New Issues #1"": Michael Dykes, Robert Herdt, Ronald Olson, Margaret Mellon, Leon Corzine, Russell Kremer; ""New Topics #2"": Carol Tucker Foreman, Lisa Zannoni, Josephine Hunt, Duane Grant, Richard Crowder, Alison Van Eenennaam;  ""Introduction"":  Daryl Buss, Jerome Slocum, Gregory Jaffe, Bradley Shurdut, Randal Giroux, Carole Cramer,
Patricia Layton.

Following the 12th plenary session and with the substantial completion of another consensus report, a new work group was established to begin to help frame the committee's next project on the impacts of biotechnology coexistence considerations on agriculture and USDA for discussion by the full committee. (All previous work groups were no longer in existence). Members selected for this open-ended work group were Josephine Hunt, Leon Corzine, Michael Dykes, Russ Kremer, Mardi Mellon, and Nicholas Kalaitzandonakes.");

The Lake Clark National Park SRC met on February 16, 2006 in Port Alworth, AK took the following actions on Federal Subsistence wildlife proposals:
The Lake Clark National Park Subsistence Resource Commission (SRC) met on February 16, 2006 and considered the following wildlife proposals to make regulatory changes to the federal subsistence program. With regard to proposals 01, 02 and 23, the Lake Clark SRC makes the following recommendations: 

PROPOSAL 1: To prevent commercialization in the sale of handicrafts made from bear parts. 

Support. The SRC supports measures that allow qualified subsistence users to maximize the benefits derived from legally harvested bears taken in the subsistence hunt.

PROPOSAL 2: To allow qualified subsistence users to sell handicraft articles made from non edible byproducts of wildlife harvested for subsistence purposes.

Support. The SRC supports measures that allow subsistence users to maximize the benefits derived from legally harvested wildlife taken in subsistence hunts.

PROPOSAL 23: To create a new subsistence permit hunt for Dall sheep in Unit 9(B).

Support with modification. The SRC supports the creation of a new Federal registration permit hunt for Dall sheep inside Lake Clark National Park and Preserve with the following amendments. 

First, there is a typographic error in the section describing the proposed regulation. The version in the proposal book states, “1 ram with 7/8  3/4  curl or larger horns.” The proposed regulation should delete the reference to 7/8 and read, “1 ram with ¾ curl or larger horns.”  






We also recommend that the permit condition concerning taking sheep above 1000 feet be amended as follows:

“No sheep may be taken above the 1000 foot elevation line designated on the map accompanying the permit.”

The SRC discussed at length how hunters could easily identify the 1000 foot elevation line to avoid confusion and inadvertent violation of the permit condition. After consultation with park staff, it was decided that the NPS will produce a topographic map with a clearly delineated 1000 foot elevation line and give a copy to each hunter requesting a permit.

We further recommend that the proposal be amended to include the following language to allow the park Superintendent to close the sheep hunt if the harvest limit is taken before the end of the published hunting season:

“If the allowable harvest levels are reached before the regular closing date, the Superintendent of Lake Clark National Park and Preserve will announce an early closure.”

This language will help prevent over harvesting of Dall sheep by delegating the authority to close the hunt to a local official who is actively monitoring hunting activity and success.


The Lake Clark National Park Subsistence Resource Commission appreciates the opportunity to share with you its recommendations on these federal subsistence proposals.

The figure in 18d includes military Board members salary and travel.  Please note that the travel figure for consultants is for invitations travel orders for outside speakers.");

The recent restructuring of the IRS has brought with it a great deal of change.  IRS executives are working to reduce burden on America's taxpayers and consider their perspective in making decisions on policy and procedures.  The panel serves as a unique forum of private citizens.  They gather public input and can make recommendations based on the feedback and issues that they are hearing from taxpayers.  In addition, they can and have served as focus groups for IRS teams.  Since the panels are established with volunteers from a broad spectrum of backgrounds, their opinions are reflective of the opinions of the general taxpaying public.  Panel members have served as focus groups on a number of issues including:  notice and publication revisions (particularly for EITC); the dual notice initiative; the installment agreement annual notice; oral agreements; and Offers in Compromise.   

Executives from various Operating Divisions within the Internal Revenue Service have attended panel meetings providing input, answers and information on many open issues.  Panel members from all panels will attend high level executive planning meetings concerning issues such as: EIN, (Employer ID Numbers), Notice and Clarity Redesign, and Establishment of Kiosks to better service the taxpaying public. Panel members have been included in the problem solving process for a number of elevated issues and have established a direct contact with the agency owners of the processes designed to correct or improve service. 
The following are just a few examples of areas where the panels have cooperated with the Operating Divisions in affecting positive change.  The New York panel made recommendations for modifying the format of Small Business Workshops.  They suggested that the workshops be broken down into individual modules so that participants could pick and choose which segments they needed to attend; and to offer modules during evening hours.  The local office adapted these recommended changes, which have been very favorably received by the business owners in the community.  As a result of links with Customer Service the Pacific-Northwest panel was instumental in the creation of a computerized fill--in form for substitute W-2s.  In the past, Customer Service Representatives (CSRs) maintained the paper forms at their desks and completed them by hand.  The fill-in form will save time and provide the taxpayer a professional, legible copy.  IRS executives agree to continue this type of dialogue for filing season readiness issues.

The Midwest panel continues to advocate for increased face-to-face services, through mobile-based services, multilingual services, and customer driven hours of operation and location. A Midwest CAP recommendation concerning the timeliness of estate tax closing letters, was influential in decisions by an IRS Redesign team to centralize the processing of estate and gift tax returns. At the invitation of the Employer Identification Number (EIN) Improvement Team, the Midwest panel worked directly with the IRS to improve the service provided by Tele-TIN and simplify the Form SS-4, ""Application for Employer Identification Number"".  The Florida panel recommended a checkbox allowing limited representation by the return preparer which was implemented by the Service for the Year 2000 filing season.  Additional efforts by the Florida panel have resulted in linkages with the Wage and Investment and Small Business Self Employed Operating Divisions for improvements to field services to taxpayers, toll free telephone improvements and notice and forms clarity and redesign.");

The AFEB has its origins in the Board for the Investigation and Control of Influenza and Other Epidemic Diseases in the Army. The Board was conceived at the beginning of World War II and established formally by the Secretary of War on January 11, 1941. When the Board was founded its mission had the following components: (1) to advise the Surgeon General on matters pertaining to preventive medicine; (2) to be prepared to investigate through laboratory and epidemiological study, outbreaks of infectious disease; and (3) to conduct laboratory and other types of research on the pathogenesis, spread, control, and prevention of diseases of concern to the Army. 

In 1946 the Board became known as the Army Epidemiological Board. The Board received its present designation, the AFEB, in 1949 and was given triservice responsibilities in the field of preventive medicine. In 1953, the AFEB was chartered under the Department of Defense. Under its initial charters the AFEB advised the Surgeons General and the Department of Defense, but also conducted and directed specific research programs through its Commissions. 

Subsequent to Congressional action sharply limited all advisory committees within the Executive Branch, the AFEB was dissolved on December 31, 1972 and recreated under a revised charter on January 3, 1973. The mission of the AFEB was directed to scientific and technical advice and assistance; the Board's responsibility for the conduct and oversight of field investigations and contract research was eliminated. 

The current charter assigns the AFEB the responsibility to consider medical issues as they may relate to operations, policy, and research and development, and include, but are not necessarily limited to, preventive medicine, occupational and environmental health, and health promotion programs. The AFEB prepares findings and makes recommendations based on technological and epidemiological principles to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs and the Surgeons General of the Military Services.

The Board currently considers and makes formal recommendations on approximately 15 issues annually.  Each recommendation requires approximately 30 person days or 240 hours of consultant time to finalize.  Purchased, this work is estimated to cost the DoD an estimated $1.08M - $1.62M.

Implementation of the FY02 recommendations on recruit accession are estimated to have saved the DoD over $3.4M annually in direct costs and streamlined the accession process for officers and enlisted, increasing the number of military recruits accessed.

The AFEB has its origins in the Board for the Investigation and Control of Influenza and Other Epidemic Diseases in the Army. The Board was conceived at the beginning of World War II and established formally by the Secretary of War on January 11, 1941. When the Board was founded its mission had the following components: (1) to advise the Surgeon General on matters pertaining to preventive medicine; (2) to be prepared to investigate through laboratory and epidemiological study, outbreaks of infectious disease; and (3) to conduct laboratory and other types of research on the pathogenesis, spread, control, and prevention of diseases of concern to the Army. 

In 1946 the Board became known as the Army Epidemiological Board. The Board received its present designation, the AFEB, in 1949 and was given triservice responsibilities in the field of preventive medicine. In 1953, the AFEB was chartered under the Department of Defense. Under its initial charters the AFEB advised the Surgeons General and the Department of Defense, but also conducted and directed specific research programs through its Commissions. 

Subsequent to Congressional action sharply limited all advisory committees within the Executive Branch, the AFEB was dissolved on December 31, 1972 and recreated under a revised charter on January 3, 1973. The mission of the AFEB was directed to scientific and technical advice and assistance; the Board's responsibility for the conduct and oversight of field investigations and contract research was eliminated. 

The current charter assigns the AFEB the responsibility to consider medical issues as they may relate to operations, policy, and research and development, and include, but are not necessarily limited to, preventive medicine, occupational and environmental health, and health promotion programs. The AFEB prepares findings and makes recommendations based on technological and epidemiological principles to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs and the Surgeons General of the Military Services.

The Board currently considers and makes formal recommendations on approximately 15 issues annually.  This service is provided without compensation, requires approximately 30 person days or 240 hours of consultant time per recommendation, and is conservatively estimated to save the Department over $3.5 million.  

The impact of Board recommendations can be immediate and significant.  In a series of adopted recommendations on accession health issues, independent and evidence-based analysis by the AFEB allowed barriers in the officer accession process that had existed for over 30 years to be removed.  This series of in-depth reviews resulted in elimination of needless screening practices that is projected to save over $6 million annually.  By leveraging the expertise of the AFEB to assist the Department in arriving at these accession policy decisions, approximately one year was eliminated from the review and recommendation process and the Department saved an estimated $1.5 million.

	At the same time, the Board serves as a guardian of institutional integrity, assisting the President to ensure the University continues to fulfill its stated mission.  To offer that level of support and challenge, if necessary, the Board must operate independently of the University, while maintaining open communication with both the President of the National Defense University and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

The Board continues to perform the role for which it was originally formed.  Since the establishment of the original Board in 1977, the University has grown considerably.  The Institute for National Strategic Studies (INSS) and the Information Resources Management College (IRMC) were established within NDU in 1984 and 1990 respectively.  In 1997 and 1998, the Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies (CHDS) and the Center for Defense Leadership and Management Program (CDLAMP) became part of NDU.  In 2002 CDLAMP became the School for National Security Executive Education (SNSEE) with Homeland Security Education as its core program.

In 1998, under the terms of the Defense Reform Initiative (DRI), the Office of Net Assessment Corporate Fellows Program and the National Security Education Program (NSEP) joined the University.  In 2000, three additional elements were created and joined the University: the Near East-South Asia Center for Strategic Studies, the Africa Center for Strategic Studies, and the Center for Technology and National Security Policy.  The BOV serves all the new University components, as well as the original colleges.

Balanced membership is maintained on the Board.  Members represent a broad spectrum of expertise in government, business and education.  In addition, there is a balance between military and civilian national security practitioners, academicians and civilian leaders in public service and the private sector.

No existing staff or advisory committees can perform the Board's functions.  As in all highly regarded academic institutions, the observations, reviews and criticism of accomplished persons in various disciplines and professional backgrounds outside the faculty structure and government are needed to maintain a viable and forward looking educational program for senior students representing diverse professional backgrounds.  Accordingly, it is highly desirable to have an advisory board whose members have served at the highest levels of policy and decision-making in the Services, Federal Government, academia, and other realms, where they are recognized as top authorities in their field.
In February 1997, upon completion of an extended candidacy process, NDU received notification of accreditation by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.  Accreditation empowers the University to grant masters degrees to its senior college students upon their graduation.  One of the criteria established as a standard for accreditation (contained in the Commission on Higher Education's publication, Characteristics of Excellence in Higher Education) is that a university must have ""a governing board actively fulfilling its responsibilities of policy and resource development.""  In other words, since receiving re-accreditation in 2002, NDU's retention of a governing board, i.e., its Board of Visitors, was no longer discretionary.

Note that all meetings have a simple information component consisting of the superintendent's report in which more or less detailed updates are given by park staff on matters in which the represented bodies have had or do have an interest.  Even absent a formal agenda action item this steady and reliable exchange of information is very helpful to the overall transparency of park management decisions.  All meetings are open to the public and the media.

The Committee recommends that NASS develop standards and procedures, in time for the release of the 2002 Census of Agriculture, to allow for the briefing of the Commissioners of Agriculture, and/or their equivalents or designees.  The briefing would be three hours prior to the release of nonmarket sensitive reports.  The information presented in the briefings would be embargoed until the public release of the NASS report, but the early briefing would allow commissioners time to prepare for public questions.  The committee offers the following guidelines for the procedures and requests that NASS allow the committee the opportunity to review and comment on the draft procedures.

	-Briefing would be conducted by the State Statistician or other appropriate NASS representative.

	-Briefing would be based on an executive summary or press release prepared from the full report.

	-The commissioner should sign the standard NASS non-disclosure form.  Any designee should be identified in advance.

Recommendation 2

The 2002 Census of Agriculture used special procedures on Indian Reservations in MT, SD and ND, which left a large void in coverage of reservations in the Agriculture Census in other states.  The committee recommends that the Secretary of Agriculture and NASS conduct a follow-on survey of Indian Reservations and this survey be completed prior to 2005.   Further, the committee recommends that the Secretary and NASS assist and support the securing of funding to accomplish this task.

Recommendation 3

The committee formed a subcommittee to address census gathering and data correlation for minority agriculture groups.  The members of this subcommittee are Dr. Bobby Phills, Edmund Gomez, Sheila Massey, Ross Racine, and a NASS employee to be named.

Recommendation 4

Whereas the availability of accurate information is necessary for the department to:

	-Provide data for markets to function;

	-Perform mandatory monitoring of agricultural programs; and

	-Provide information to congress for decision making regarding food programs for the needy, financing for agriculture, food safety programs, and soil and moisture conservation.

The committee therefore recommends that the Secretary of Agriculture make every effort to maintain the strict confidentiality of all data collected under the provisions of the United States code (Title 7, Section 2276) in order to maintain the cooperation of all those providing this voluntary data.

Recommendation 5

In order to expand support of NASS programs at the state and local levels and to assist in preparation for the 2007 Census of Agriculture, the committee strongly recommends that  all State Statisticians conduct annual focus group meetings commencing in 2003 for the purpose of strengthening program efforts at the state level and preparing state strategies for the anticipated success of the 2007 Census of Agriculture.  Through this process, every effort will be made to be inclusive of all eligible farmers and ranchers in their respective states.  The focus groups will include representatives from all sectors of the agricultural and academic community.

Recommendation 6

The Committee strongly supports the accelerated adoption of valuable Integrated Pest Management practices on agricultural working lands in the United States.  In accordance, the Committee supports the formation of a partnership between NASS, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and other stakeholder organizations  to evaluate the effectiveness of conservation programs imbedded in the 2002 Farm Bill.  The committee recommends that the evaluation incorporate measures of IPM adoption and biological metrics to evaluate IPM effectiveness across the array of major and minor crops.

Recommendation 7 (Refer to Appendix II - Report of Subcommittee)

Inasmuch as the NASS Monthly Hogs and Pigs Report appears to be of minimal value to the industry and is a burden on producer respondents, and whereas the Quarterly Hogs and Pigs Report provides valuable, detailed, and state-level data, the subcommittee appointed to examine the hog survey, concerned that the monthly report could adversely affect the quality of the Quarterly Hogs and Pigs Report, hereby recommends:

	-That the Monthly Hogs and Pigs Survey be discontinued as soon as possible,

	-That the budget savings, thereby realized, be used to enhance and improve the Quarterly Hogs and Pigs Survey,

	-That NASS work with hog producers to make the quarterly survey consistent with industry records and,

	-That NASS develop electronic reporting instruments.

The NGRAC, a statutory committee, was established in March 1992, under the USDA Departmental Regulation 1043-8 as directed by Section 1632 of P.L. 101-624 of the 1990 Farm Bill. Its charter was last renewed in March 1999 and expired in March 2001.  The NGRAC is appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture, and its duties are solely advisory to the Secretary and the Director of the National Genetic Resources Program (NGRP) on matters concerning the NGRP, established by the U.S. Congress to: acquire, characterize, preserve, document, and distribute to scientists germplasm of all life forms important for food and agricultural production. The NGRAC responds to the important issues of the nation in respect to conserving and utilizing genetic resources for food and agriculture. It meets twice a year, and can consist of up to nine members appointed by the Secretary and seven or more ex-officio members. Two-thirds of the appointed members represent the scientific disciplines relevant to NGRP, and one-third represent the general public in relevant activities. Thus, it is likely that each of the life forms in NGRP (plants, forest species, animals, aquatics, insects, and microbes) is represented by only one appointed scientific member.  The most recent meeting of the NGRAC was in August 1999 in Washington, D.C.Five new members were newly appointed in September 2000. The NGRAC’s most recent recommendations to the Department and the Program are included on its web page at http://www.ars-grin.gov/ngrac/

Currently, the NGRAC is inactive, pending rechartering.  New members must be appointed, or current members reappointed.  It would meet at least once, and perhaps twice, in 2004, likely in the mid-late spring, and early autumn. The agenda for such meeting would, of course, be strongly determined by the chair and members, but the following issue would likely merit high priority for discussion: 1) international genetic resource treaties and agreements, e.g., the International Treaty for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture; 2) review of USDA’s progress with acting on the previous NGRAC recommendation to the USDA and the NGRP to develop a road map (more explicit in relevant content than the broad Agricultural Research Service Six-Year Plan) and strategic plan for its genetic resources and genomics programs; 3) review of activities of other Advisory Committees, in particular those that deal with genetic resources, such as the ones on Agricultural Biotechnology and Invasive Species; 4) review of current budgets and fiscal status of USDA genetic resource programs; 5) review recent domestic and international developments associated with the application of intellectual property rights protection to plant genetic resources.");

The Advisory Committee recommends that NASS directs its State Statistician in New Mexico to take a leadership role in forming a working group including personnel from New Mexico State University Extension Service, New Mexico State Department of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency (FSA), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and other relevant agencies to develop a pilot project to conduct a follow-up survey of Indian reservation and other minority farmers and ranchers in New Mexico.

$	The State Statistician should submit a proposal to Headquarters for approval and such proposal should include names of cooperators, time-line for completion and funding needed for the project to be completed by December 2005.  It should be noted that successful completion of this pilot project should serve as a model for other State Statistical Offices.
$	We further recommend that NASS also identify alternative funding strategies/mechanisms in case additional funding is not received from the Department or Congress.

Recommendation 2

The Advisory Committee recommends that the Secretary of Agriculture and NASS embark on a department-wide concerted effort to ensure that all agencies’ efforts are collectively conducted in a fashion that brings about the enumeration of all minorities involved in agriculture.  NASS should take the lead and work with the State Departments of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency (FSA), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Rural Development, Risk Management Agency, and Cooperative State Research Education, and Extension Service to invite representatives of minority groups to participate in meetings to ensure they are enumerated within each state.

Recommendation 3

The Advisory Committee recommends that NASS make the Minority and Small Farm subcommittee a standing subcommittee, and coordinate its efforts on minority participation with other NASS supported groups and committees, i.e. the National Enumeration and Outreach working group, and any others that may evolve.

Recommendation 4

The Advisory Committee recommends that NASS discuss with Statistics Canada the possibility of publishing a quarterly combined U.S. and Canadian hog inventory report.

Recommendation 5

The Advisory Committee recommends that NASS capture on-farm value added to agricultural production and agri-tourism for the 2007 Census of Agriculture.

Recommendation 6

The Advisory Committee recommends that NASS organize a subcommittee to the NASS Advisory Committee to explore improvements in the data collection of pesticides use in agricultural and non-agricultural applications.  These improvements would include analysis, processing, and communication of crop protection product information.  A variety of government, academic, and industry efforts now collect pesticide use data for research, business, marketing, regulatory, and risk assessment purposes.

$	Restricted access to some of these sources of data limits their utility for important regulatory purposes.  Coordination and collaboration among such data efforts could reduce or eliminate such barriers.  Furthermore, overlap and duplication of effort can be identified and reduced with economic benefits for all involved.
$	Such a subcommittee could have a limited assignment of six months to a year, to explore the options for improvements in pesticide use data collection, and report back to the NASS Advisory Committee with recommendations for NASS and other stakeholders.

Jack Mitenbuler was named chair of this committee.  He was instructed to provide a list of potential subcommittee members for review and approval of the committee.

Recommendation 7

The Advisory Committee recommends that NASS establish a one year working subcommittee to address under-served and under-reported agriculture developments associated with land use transformation changes including but not exclusively:

$	Sprawl (rapid change in or loss of agricultural lands)
$	Specialty crop agriculture with developments or rapid change in
$	Retirement farming
$	Hobby farming
$	Specialty crops developments 
$	Agri-tourism
$	Farm stay movement 

$	The subcommittee would address agricultural developments associated with land use transformation changes to explore and develop already existing data into new statistics relevant to these changes.

Mark Whalon and Ron Plain were named to this subcommittee. 

Recommendation 8

The Advisory Committee recommends that NASS should not have any responsibility in the development, planning or implementation in any National livestock identification system.

$	We further recommend that NASS should have access to such databases after its establishment to enhance the efficiency of NASS operations.

Recommendation 9

The Advisory Committee recommends that NASS should explore how to incorporate collection of data on certified organic production into the 2007 Census of Agriculture, ARMS, other surveys, and reports by commodity.

The NGRAC, a statutory committee, was established in March 1992, under the USDA Departmental Regulation 1043-8 as directed by Section 1632 of P.L. 101-624 of the 1990 Farm Bill. Its charter was last renewed in March 1999 and expired in March 2001.  The NGRAC is appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture, and its duties are solely advisory to the Secretary and the Director of the National Genetic Resources Program (NGRP) on matters concerning the NGRP, established by the U.S. Congress to: acquire, characterize, preserve, document, and distribute to scientists germplasm of all life forms important for food and agricultural production. The NGRAC responds to the important issues of the nation in respect to conserving and utilizing genetic resources for food and agriculture. It meets twice a year, and can consist of up to nine members appointed by the Secretary and seven or more ex-officio members. Two-thirds of the appointed members represent the scientific disciplines relevant to NGRP, and one-third represent the general public in relevant activities. Thus, it is likely that each of the life forms in NGRP (plants, forest species, animals, aquatics, insects, and microbes) is represented by only one appointed scientific member.  The most recent meeting of the NGRAC was in August 1999 in Washington, D.C.Five new members were newly appointed in September 2000. The NGRAC’s most recent recommendations to the Department and the Program are included on its web page at http://www.ars-grin.gov/ngrac/

Currently, the NGRAC is inactive, pending rechartering.  New members must be appointed, or current members reappointed.  It would meet at least once, and perhaps twice, in 2004, likely in the mid-late spring, and early autumn. The agenda for such meeting would, of course, be strongly determined by the chair and members, but the following issue would likely merit high priority for discussion: 1) international genetic resource treaties and agreements, e.g., the International Treaty for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture; 2) review of USDA’s progress with acting on the previous NGRAC recommendation to the USDA and the NGRP to develop a road map (more explicit in relevant content than the broad Agricultural Research Service Six-Year Plan) and strategic plan for its genetic resources and genomics programs; 3) review of activities of other Advisory Committees, in particular those that deal with genetic resources, such as the ones on Agricultural Biotechnology and Invasive Species; 4) review of current budgets and fiscal status of USDA genetic resource programs; 5) review recent domestic and international developments associated with the application of intellectual property rights protection to plant genetic resources.");

The March 2004 Board Meeting, for the first time, generated four separate “Recommendations’ Reports” to the Secretary, as a result of a newly funded competitive grants program on “Integrated Organic Agriculture,” as well as the Board’s desire to follow-up after a several year time span on the “Progress of the Peer Review Process for National Research Programs of the Agricultural Research Service.”  The other two reports resulted from 1) the Focus Session held during the Board Meeting on “Agriculture, Natural Resources and the Environment” and 2) the complex and detailed review of the REE portfolio on “Relevance and Adequacy of Funding”  (a congressional mandate).  The REE Advisory Board Office of USDA coordinated all agendas and activities for the four Board subgroups, who worked actively during the same 3-4 month period.  This was also the time period when the REE Advisory Board Office began the 6-month nomination process for approximately one-third of its members whose term would expire at the end of the fiscal year, as well as the time when a new Program Planning Committee began to plan and organize a summer 2004 Regional Listening Session for stakeholders.  This year marked a period when USDA responded to the Board’s advice and shared information on departmental and REE activities in clear positive ways.  For example, the Board’s Focus Session held last October 2003 on “Obesity Prevention Research” resulted in an in-person meeting later that winter of the Board Officers with the Secretary of Agriculture and the Under Secretary for REE.  The REE Under Secretary reported that a working group had been established so the agency representatives could meet at least once a month to discuss effective ways to elevate the obesity crisis within the Department and across other federal agencies.  An “Obesity Conference” was held by USDA’s REE in late October 2004 to bring together high-level officials from other federal departments and agencies to discuss how “obesity prevention” could be addressed within the Administration.  The October 2004 Board meeting was held just following the “Obesity Conference” to provide the opportunity for Board members and other interested individuals to attend both meetings while in the Washington DC area.  Another example  shows increased communication and collaboration between USDA and the Board in the planning of the Board’s October 2004 Focus Session on the topic of “current and emerging animal and plant diseases and pathogens.”  This meeting required representation from containment facilities of the Agricultural Research Institute, the Department of Homeland Security; representation from USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service; and the National Institutes of Health.  The REE Under Secretary and Deputy Under Secretary discussed with the Board officers and the Board’s Executive Committee the progress being made within the Department across all mission areas on homeland security issues, including those related to the animal and plant diseases.  Ongoing positive communication and information sharing between the Board and USDA, especially during the Board’s program planning period for the October 2004 meeting, made the Board more aware of activities already underway by USDA as well as specific areas where USDA desired the Board’s advice.  This communication saved much time in the program planning as well as identified important homeland security activities already underway within the Department – preventing excessive time spent by the Board on “Who is doing what?” and allowing more time on the program’s substance and speaker invitations.  The Board’s revamped web site has benefited Board members as well as the general public by providing up-to-date information on Board-related activities as well as quick access to information on an upcoming Board Meeting (such as a brief news alert and a draft meeting agenda).  Program planning for meetings by subgroups of the Board are discussed at conference calls as well as via e-mail.  The use of electronic communication by Board members to conduct business has rapidly increased over the year.  This has saved much time for Board members who have busy schedules as well as has saved considerable costs of federal dollars. This Advisory Board has received much respect and recognition by stakeholders and has been a positive model for other USDA advisory committees.");

After the second plenary meeting, three ad hoc working groups were established to develop information for the committee on future issues and concerns relating to three classes of biotechnology-derived products:   Group I-- crop (and transgenic terrestrial livestock animal) improvements; Group II-- quality improvements; and crop (and transgenic terrestrial livestock animal) specialty products.  The group members are:
Group I: Richard Crowder, Randal Giroux, Duane Grant, David Hoisington, Greg Jaffe, Keith Triebwasser, Lisa Zannoni.
Group II: Terry Medley, Margaret Mellon, Ronald Olson, Jerome Slocum.
Group III: Daryl Buss, Leon Corzine, Carole Cramer, Michael Dykes, Juan Enriquez-Cabot, Randal Giroux, David Magnus.

Following the December, 2003 plenary session, Work Groups were reorganized, with the following 3 new drafting groups:

Issues (that may arise over the next decade, for the 5-to-10 year perspective report):  Daryl Buss, Duane Grant, Michael Dykes, Greg Jaffe, Carole Cramer.

Scenarios for the future (for the 5-to-10 year perspective report):  Juan Enriquez, Jerry Slocum, Margaret Mellon, Terry Medley, Keith Triebwasser, Dave Hoisington.

A separate Traceability and Labeling Report:  Ron Olson, Randall Giroux, Greg Jaffe, Leon Corzine, Lisa Zannoni, Richard Crowder.

Work groups are open-ended, and any additional committee members may particiapte in work group discussions at their discretion.  Groups will meet in closed session via conference calls between plenary sessions, but all materials generated in those calls will be brought to plenary sessions for public discussion.

After her appointment to the AC21 in February, 2004, Carole Tucker Foreman joined the Issues Work Group.

Following the September, 2004, AC21 plenary session, the Issues Work Group was expanded to include all the members of the Traceability and Labeling Report group as well (that group continued to work on its other report also).

	At the same time, the Board serves as a guardian of institutional integrity, assisting the President to ensure the University continues to fulfill its stated mission.  To offer that level of support and challenge, if necessary, the Board must operate independently of the University, while maintaining open communication with both the President of the National Defense University and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

The Board continues to perform the role for which it was originally formed.  Since the establishment of the original Board in 1977, the University has grown considerably.  The Institute for National Strategic Studies (INSS) and the Information Resources Management College (IRMC) were established within NDU in 1984 and 1990 respectively.  In 1997 and 1998, the Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies (CHDS) and the Center for Defense Leadership and Management Program (CDLAMP) became part of NDU.  In 2002 CDLAMP became the School for National Security Executive Education (SNSEE) with Counterterrism Education as its core program. In 2004 the Institute for Homeland Security Studies was established with Homeland Security Education as its core program and the Center for Counterproliferation Research underwent a name change; its new name is ""the Center for Weapons of Mass Destruction; its core mission remains unchanged 

In 1998, under the terms of the Defense Reform Initiative (DRI), the Office of Net Assessment Corporate Fellows Program and the National Security Education Program (NSEP) joined the University.  In 2000, three additional elements were created and joined the University: the Near East-South Asia Center for Strategic Studies, the Africa Center for Strategic Studies, and the Center for Technology and National Security Policy.  The BOV serves all the new University components, as well as the original colleges.

Balanced membership is maintained on the Board.  Members represent a broad spectrum of expertise in government, business and education.  In addition, there is a balance between military and civilian national security practitioners, academicians and civilian leaders in public service and the private sector.

No existing staff or advisory committees can perform the Board's functions.  As in all highly regarded academic institutions, the observations, reviews and criticism of accomplished persons in various disciplines and professional backgrounds outside the faculty structure and government are needed to maintain a viable and forward looking educational program for senior students representing diverse professional backgrounds.

Accordingly, it is highly desirable to have an advisory board whose members have served at the highest levels of policy and decision-making in the Services, Federal Government, academia, and other realms, where they are recognized as top authorities in their field.
In February 1997, upon completion of an extended candidacy process, NDU received notification of accreditation by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.  Accreditation empowers the University to grant masters degrees to its senior college students upon their graduation.  One of the criteria established as a standard for accreditation (contained in the Commission on Higher Education's publication, Characteristics of Excellence in Higher Education) is that a university must have ""a governing board actively fulfilling its responsibilities of policy and resource development.""  In other words, since receiving re-accreditation in 2002, NDU's retention of a governing board, i.e., its Board of Visitors, was no longer discretionary.

BIFAD IN THE 21ST CENTURY*

G. Edward Schuh**

Footnotes for the bottom of the first page:
· Concluding comments, meeting of the Board on International Food and Agricultural Development (BIFAD), Washington, D.C., March 30, 2001.

**  Chair, BIFAD, and Regents Professor of International Economic Policy, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.


	This will probably be my last meeting with the Board.  My appointment terminates in July, and although we continue to serve our constituents until we are replaced, this will probably be the last meeting at which I preside.  This is thus a good time to thank those who have supported me and other members of the Board, both from within the Agency for International Development and from within the university community.  The assistance of people from each side of the relationship has been impressive, and much appreciated.

	The remainder of my remarks is divided into three parts.  First, I will discuss the institutional changes through which the BIFAD has passed these last six years.  These have been significant, and hopefully will have a lasting impact on the ability of U.S. universities to collaborate with the Agency for International Development.  Then I will discuss the changing environment in which economic development takes place.  Finally, I will have some thoughts about the future.  At the end, I will have some concluding comments.

Institutional Changes

	The BIFAD was recreated about six years ago, after a period in which it was in abeyance.  The previous members of the Board had resigned en masse because they did not feel the Agency was taking it seriously. I was appointed chair of what I often describe as the reincarnation of the Board, and some of my contemporary colleagues were appointed at that same time.

	During this most recent period we have tended to meet three times a 
year, or once every four months.  At each of our meetings we have tended to take up some substantive issue in economic and agricultural development.  However, we have also spent some time at each of our meetings in revitalizing and redesigning the institutional arrangements that support the substantive work of the Board and the Title XII program.  In fact, over the last six years we have updated, reformed, and revised each of the major institutional arrangements that constitute the Title XII program.  In my judgement they are now ready to support a revitalized and renewed economic development program.

	One of the first issues we addressed was the revision of the CRSP Guidelines, the basic document for the Collaborative Research Support Programs.  The CRSP programs are one of the key mechanisms through which the Agency for International Development collaborates with the U.S.- university community, and through which it addresses global food security issues.  The Guidelines had been in place virtually unchanged since the inception of the CRSP program.  Revising the Guidelines took a relatively long process, and involved the collaboration of Agency staff and representatives from the universities.

	Another part of the institutional arrangements needing revision was the original Title XII legislation.  With leadership from Ed Price of Texas A & M University, and from colleagues within the Agency, important revisions were made in the legislation.  Most of these were aimed at broadening the mission of the program.  Some of them were in the nature of fine-tuning, but still essential revisions to adapt to the changes in the economic environment in which our programs operate.

	One of the problems when the BIFAD was reactivated in 1996 was that some of the main elements of the past were not re-established.  One of these was the JCARD - the Joint Committee on Agricultural Research and Development.  The JCARD had in the past been an important means by which criteria for programs were established, and by means of which program decisions were made with input from both the university community and the Agency.

	There seemed to be little chance that the JCARD itself was going to be recreated.  Consequently, the Board worked with both the university community and Agency staff to create the SPARE, an arrangement designed to do many of the same things the JCARD once did.  An important feature of the new arrangement is that it brings the NASULGC's Board on Agriculture into formal collaboration with the Board and the Agency.

	Support for foreign aid has declined dramatically in this county.  One of the first initiatives of the re-established BIFAD was to consider how the constituency for foreign aid could be rebuilt.  The Board returned to this issue a number of times during recent years.

	A related issue - and one that is important to those who understand that agriculture is the key to broad-based economic development and the alleviation of poverty, was the deterioration in the support for agriculture within the Agency.  The agricultural staff had been decimated by successive Reductions in Forces (RIFs) and the budget support for agriculture had declined substantially.  In fact, some have referred to the Agency as the ""International Agency for Health Care"" - a reflection of the growing attention given to health care issues rather than to general economic development.

The Board made the revitalization of support for agriculture (and implicitly, economic development) one of its key objectives, and has had some success in doing so.  New agricultural staff are being appointed, and the budget support for agriculture is beginning to increase again.  Although the new staff appointments still do not make up for the number who are retiring, with the result that the number of technical agricultural staff is still declining, the willingness to appoint new agricultural staff is a hopeful harbinger for the future.

	A more challenging problem when the Board was re-established some six years ago was the strained relations between the Agency and the university community.  The suspension of the activities of the Board had been created by the resignation en mass of the members of the Board.  The resignation was due to what the members believed was a lack of support from the Agency.  People on both sides of the relationship had been unhappy for some time, but it suddenly came to a crescendo, and an almost complete breakdown in communications.

	We have gradually been able to rebuild the relationship, and to get representatives from both sides back on the same page.  The Board undertook a number of confidence-building activities that have helped rebuild what historically was a very valuable relationship.  Let's hope we can continue to communicate with each other, and to continue to strengthen a partnership that is almost unique in international development efforts around the world.

	One of the continuing significant breaks with the past, however, has been the lack of staff support for the activities of the Board.  In earlier days the BIFAD had a full-time Executive Director in an office in Washington, D.C., backed by a number of full-time staff and a significant operational budget. When the Board was re-established, none of those support arrangements were recreated.  Some part-time staff in the Agency were assigned to work with the Board, but they had other responsibilities as well.  In effect, the Chair of the Board had to provide the leadership for developing programs and the agendas by working with these part-time people, mostly on the telephone.

	Eventually, we were able to negotiate support for a part-time person and a research assistant at the University of Minnesota to support the Chair and the Board.  This was helpful, but it still does not provide the support a full-time person in Washington would provide.  The difficulty the Chair faces in developing the agendas for the meetings is that he is not in residence in Washington where he could be tracking the activities of the Agency and developments in Congress.  This additional support has made it possible to expand the meetings from two one-day meetings a year to three two-day meetings, with a much broader agenda.

	These changes in the operational details of the Board and how it operates are very important.  My own view is that the support for the Board still needs to be strengthened.  Even with a much smaller foreign aid budget, and with agriculture making up a smaller portion of the total, the Board has much to offer to the Agency in providing an important link to one of its most important constituencies, and in providing technical advice to the Agency.

	Another change in BIFAD arrangements was in the composition of the Board.  In the earlier era the Board was made up mostly of university presidents, and presidents from major universities.  When the Board was re-established, there were no university presidents among its membership.  This amounted to the loss of a great deal of political support and influence for the Agency.  The Chair of the Board has since his appointment to the Board argued that new appointments to the Board should be university presidents.  We now have one such appointment.  Let's hope that process continues.  University presidents can speak with much more authority on the national scene than regular academics or representatives from the private sector.

	A final change in the institutional arrangements for the BIFAD was to make the Board an integral part of this nation's Food Security Advisory Committee, with the Chair of the Board being the co-chair of the larger Committee.  This was a development that followed the World Food Security Forum in Rome, and reflected the need for a mechanism to provide broad-based advice to the Interagency Working Group that prepared the original papers for that Forum and the Action Plan that followed it.  The Food Security Advisory Committee is made up of some 30 members drawn from Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), farmers and farm organizations, and consumer groups.  Being an integral part of this Advisory Committee gives the Board a much larger range of responsibilities, and increases its potential for influencing food security policy.

	Before terminating this part of my remarks I would be remiss if I did not mention the creation of the Chair's Award for Excellence in Science by the Board.  This Award is designed to recognize the significant contributions the CRSP programs make to science and to addressing the problems of poverty alleviation and food security.  The Award is made each year, with an appropriate ceremony in Washington. 

  	Let me conclude this section by noting that the major institutional arrangements relevant to the BIFAD have been revised and strengthened, the budget support for agriculture seems to be growing again, relations between the university and Agency communities have been improved, and the decline in agricultural staff has been slowed.  The Agency and the university community are now in a position to begin allocating resources once again to the modernization of agriculture in the developing countries, and thus to the alleviation of poverty on a global scale.


Changes in the International Economy

	The international economy has been undergoing dramatic changes in recent decades.  Many of these changes have very important implications for the Agency, for the BIFAD, and for the university community.  Let me address some of these changes briefly in this section.

	The first significant change, and perhaps the one with the most pervasive implications, is the process of globalization that has extended throughout the post-World War II period.  Back in the 1950s and 1960s, when foreign aid became an important part of this nation's foreign policy, it was possible to think about individual countries as autonomous and relatively independent.  Collaborative programs of foreign aid could be developed for individual countries on that basis.

	That single-country perspective is no longer possible.  The growth in international trade has changed the way one has to think about foreign aid.  Even more important, however, is the emergence of huge international financial markets which, combined with the shift to a system of flexible exchange rates, has significantly changed the fundamentals in the international economy.  The international financial markets have become an important source of international savings for use in promoting economic development.  The floating exchange rate system has an important impact on international competitiveness, and in influencing which sectors of particular economies are competitive.

	In a few words, the world has shifted from a system made up of relatively independent national economies, to one made up of national economies that are closely integrated with each other.  That integration brings with it an enormous increase in the interdependence of national policies.  For example, U.S. monetary policy has a significant impact on the economies of other countries, in large part through its influence on interest rates in international financial markets.  At the same time, however, events such as the Asian Crisis have ramifications all around the world, including in the United States.

	These are obviously very important issues, brought about by the establishment of much stronger and pervasive interdependencies.  Ironically, very little attention has been given to the forces that are driving the process of globalization.  There are some relatively popular views that it is caused by the U.S. drive for global hegemony, combined with the growing power of the multinational firms.  Less seldom is it recognized that globalization is driven by three basic technological revolutions in basic sectors in the economy: one in the transportation sector, one in the communication sector, and one in information technology.  These technological breakthroughs have enormously increased the scope for markets.  They have also greatly increased the benefits from international trade.

	It is also somewhat ironic to hear people argue as if we could go back to the days of the past when there was less interdependence.  They sound as if globalization were a process that could be shut down or reversed.  The truth of the matter is that society seldom gives up the benefits of technological breakthroughs on the order of those that are driving the process of globalization.  Moreover, the important point is that the technological revolutions that are driving the process have been limited primarily to the developed countries.  They have hardly touched the developing countries, where 80 percent of the world's population live, or the previously centrally-planned economies.  The implication is that the process of globalization is going to become increasingly profound, and increasingly complex.  That has enormous implications for the Agency, and it has enormous implications for how we must be thinking about the BIFAD.

	The second change in the international economy, and one that has been mentioned a couple of times on our program yesterday and today, is the lack of Malthusian scares in recent decades.  Such scares used to occur about once a decade, but it has been the mid-1970s since the last one, and even that one was of relatively short duration.  Moreover, the spike in commodity prices of that period turned out to be due more a monetary disturbance than a shortage of food. The lack of a Malthusian Crisis has significantly changed the economic development environment, and weakened the support for agricultural development programs.    

	It is true that we have periodic crises of hunger and famine in individual countries that flash across our television screens and dominate the news for a week or two.  However, these crises are for the most part politically motivated, and the result of national governments either hiding a problem for political reasons, or simply not knowing it exists.  The truth of the matter is that the world has done an exceedingly good job of avoiding major famines during the post-World War II period.  Lesser experiences have occurred only because logistics made it difficult to respond in sufficient time.

	There have also been a number of lesser events associated with spikes in comm");

The Board was given additional responsibilities to evaluate and review protocols of REE programs under the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act (AREERA) of 1998.  This legislation broadened the Board's obligations concerned with stakeholder input, priority setting, and accountability issues.  The Board reflects the interests of stakeholders nationwide and provides advice for agricultural research, education, extension, and economics that is vital to the current and future success of food, forestry, and agricultural programs.  The Board has already made significant contributions with recommendations on the following: Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) and the Research, Education, and Economics (REE) Strategic and Performance Plans; REE priority setting and policies; merit and peer review procedures; relevancy and adequacy of funding of REE programs (conducted annually); and public communication. The Advisory Board continually solicited stakeholder input and made changes to their recommendations on priorities and funding accordingly, and gave advice on high priority topics of public interest, such as Agricultural Biotechnology; Alternative Energy Sources; Food, Nutrition and Human Health; Cutting-Edge Science and Technology; Review of Agricultural Chemicals; Better Understanding of the Nature and Impact of Accelerating Consolidation, Concentration, and Changing Agricultural Structure; and the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems.  The importance of fostering cross institutional, cross-college, and multi-disciplinary efforts in these efforts is encouraged.  The Board has recommended the advancement of direct and long-term research funding and supported legislation to further address critical research areas. The breadth of agricultural research issues and the Board's broadened activites under the 1998 AREERA legislation, require efficient and thorough review and analyses, which are most effectively done with working groups/ad hoc committees in a teamwork approach that utilitizes a continuous mechanism of input, review, recommendations and feedback.  With the increased number of meetings required to address Board requirements, the use of conference calls has been successful and cost effective. Special Focus Sessions during full Board meetings highlight the scientific basis of agricultural research and explore new avenues of research and education for the public good.  Reports and publications serve as important resources for USDA, congressional, and public information.  These documents provide annual updates; reflect broad stakeholder views on high priorities and policies; and highlight critical food, forestry, and agricultural research, education, and extension activities.  Readers can understand emerging issues, agricultural research needs, and recognize the many public benefits resulting from Federal investments. The full 30+ member Board meets twice a year: one meeting includes a National Stakeholder Symposium; the other a Special Focus Session and Orientation for New Members.  Listening Sessions have also been held in areas outside of Washington, DC to gain regional perspectives or to gain knowledge on specialized sciences or technologies concentrated in a particular state (e.g., Research Triangle Park, in North Carolina). Recommendations by the Advisory Board to the Secretary of Agriculture have, to date, been considered very useful by USDA in its ongoing policy and priority setting deliberations.  This Advisory Board should remain fully funded to assure that there is ongoing knowledgeable and reliable advice provided to the Secretary of Agriculture and the land-grant community that is based on national stakeholder input.  This advice will continue to contribute to efficient/effective management of Federal research funding in order to provide maximal public benefit to our nation and to a successful U.S. agricultural enterprise.");

established three work groups to help prepare for its next meeting and 
to help focus subsequent discussions on three specific topics:
1) biotechnology budget priorities;2) topics for potential investigation 
on the impacts of biotechnology through the Economic Research Service 
and the National Agricultural Statistics Service; and 3) potential 
topics for study by the National Research Council's Standing Committee
on Biotechnology, Food and Fiber Production, and the Environment.  
These work groups produced frameworks used for further discussion by 
the ACAB as a whole at the second ACAB meeting, on July 26-27, 2000, 
and therefore these workgroup meetings themselves were not subject 
to the FACA.  For completeness, all of the workgroups met via 
teleconference on July 6 or July 7, 2000. In addition, The Economics 
work group and the budget group met in person on July 25, 2000 as well.  
These work groups may meet in the future as further discussions on 
these topics are called for.

The membership on these work groups is as follows:
Budget:  Carolyn Brickey, James Dodson, David Frederickson, Thomas Hoban,
Marjorie Hoy, Mark Lipson, Bruce McEvoy, Margaret Mellon, Philip Nelson, 
Austin Sullivan, David Winkles

Economics and Data: Jeffrey Burkhardt, Carol Tucker Foreman, Sharan Lanini, 
Mary-Howell Martens, Marshall Martin, Lorraine Nakai, Roger Pine, C.S. Prakash,
Frank Sims, Michael Sligh, Jerry Slocum, Michael Yost

Standing Committee Issues:  Dale Bauman, Daniel Botkin, James Cook, Rebecca 
Goldburg, Michael Hansen, Neil Harl, Chuck Johnson, Anne Kapuscinski, Ed Korwek,
Cal McCastlain, Carol Nottenburg, Virginia Weldon, Margaret Wittenberg.

At the third ACAB meeting, on November 29-30, 2000, a work group was 
established to help the ACAB consider the role of the public sector in
 plant breeding in the 21st century, and draft a report to be 
considered by the ACAB on this topic.  The members of this work 
group were: Cal McCastlain, Chuck Johnson, Mary-Howell Martens, 
Marshall Martin, Margaret Mellon, Michael Sligh, and James Cook.
This work group met by teleconference on March 16, 2001, May 16, 2001, 
July 2, 2001, and July 23, 2001.  All work of this work group (i.e.,
various drafts of the report leading up to the adoption of the consensus 
report on August 1, 2001) was reported back to the full ACAB for its 
consideration, and therefore the work of this work group, and all the 
other ACAB work groups as well) is not subject to FACA meeting requirements.  
This was a main topic of discussion at the third, fourth, and fifth ACAB 
meetings, with consensus on the report being reached at the fifth meeting.

At the fourth ACAB meeting, on April 17-18, 2001, there was detailed discussion
on the economic and legal aspects of gene flow from transgenic plants to 
other plants, a topic of continuing discussion. Between the fourth and fifth 
ACAB meetings, another work group was constituted to help frame the continuing 
discussion at the fifth plenary session on this topic.  The members of this 
work group were: Frank Sims, C. S. Prakash, Margaret Wittenberg, Neil Harl, 
Rich Lotstein, Ed Korwek, Phil Nelson, Margaret Mellon, and Mary-Howell Martens.  
This work group met via teleconference on July 19, 2001 and developed 
a draft framework for a letter on the subject of gene flow to be sent 
by the Chair of the ACAB to Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman apprising 
her of the ACAB's deliberations and the importance the ACAB attaches to
the subject.  This draft was considered at the August 1-2, 2001, ACAB meeting.
Ultimately, no consensus was reached on the text at the meeting.

The budget work group was scheduled to meet on July 16, 2001 to work
on framing the budget discussions at the upcoming ACAB meeting, but not 
enough members were available at that time for work to proceed.  However, 
at the fifth ACAB meeting, the Committee was able to develop a list of 
biotechnology budget priorities for USDA for FY 2003, and this information was 
subsequently transmitted by letter by the ACAB Chair to USDA Secretary Veneman.  
The text of the letter is available on the ACAB web site.

#3.  The Committee recommends that compelling reasons must exist to justify the use of mandatory reporting on NASS business surveys.

With the close advice and support of the Committee, the Department of State continues to work out with the CIA and NSC leaderships new procedures for expanding the Foreign Relations series to include previously highly-classified and sensitive intelligence documentation. These procedures go far to ensuring the full implementation of the statutory mandate to publish a Foreign Relations series that is ""complete and accurate."" The Committee advises on reform and modernization of the preparation and publication of volumes in the series, including use of the Internet.  The Committee closely monitors the design and implementation of the reform. The Committee also provides continuous advice and support to Department and government-wide efforts to reform the management of 25-year old and older national security records and to implement E.O. 12958 on this subject.  During the meetings, the Committee is briefed by staff from other Federal agencies, gaining additional valuable insight into the government-wide declassification effort.");

ACTION ITEM - Laboratory Accreditation
ACWI members unanimously adopted the revised recommendations of the Methods and Data Comparability Board (MDCB) on Laboratory Accreditation, including:
(1)	All Federal agencies (and commercial laboratories employed by Federal agencies) performing analytical water testing, as part of compliance or ambient
        monitoring programs, be accredited under a recognized program, in order to better establish comparability of data and to meet the needs of specific Federal agency programs.
(2)	The National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program (NELAP) is the recommended program of the Methods and Data Comparability Board.
(3)	The Board will periodically re-evaluate NELAP's suitability to serve as a national accreditation program in order: 
        (a) to review the status of their progress in these efforts; and 
        (b) to encourage state, Federal, and private participation in NELAP.
In addition, the ACWI agreed that:
·	The MDCB should provide an announcement about Laboratory Accreditation appropriate to publish in a wide range of newsletters, including those of all ACWI member organizations.
·	ACWI member agencies and organizations should make every effort to publish this information as broadly as possible.
·	The Board should indicate to the Federal agencies the actions they anticipate those agencies should carry out regarding Laboratory Accreditation. 

ACTION ITEM - Sustainable Water Resources Roundtable (SWRR)
 ACWI members endorsed the coordination and cooperation of Federal
 agencies and non-federal organizations to work on the issues of water sustainability.
·	The SWRR was accepted as an ad hoc sub-committee of ACWI, based on the proposed Terms of Reference, which will be circulated to the subcommittee for revision.
·	A Steering Committee is meeting via conference call to plan the first SWR Roundtable, which is being planned for October 2002, providing that sufficient funding can be obtained.

ACTION ITEM - Trends in Support of Water Resources Activities
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has requested that ACWI Federal agencies cooperate with the USGS Water Information Coordination Program, to compile information on changes in 
programs and trends in funding of water-related activities, and document such trends in a consistent format.
·	Toni Johnson, Chief WICP and Exec Sec ACWI will work with ACWI Federal members to identify appropriate agency staff to work on this exercise.
·	Every effort will be made to use existing data and information, and to work via conference call, supplemented by email and fax.
·	The effort will likely begin in the fall of 2002 and continue to the spring 2003 ACWI meeting.
·	An effort will be made to reflect trends over the past 3-6 years (FY 98-FY 03).

ACTION ITEM - Streamgaging Task Force Report
	The Report of ACWI's Streamgaging Task Force was distributed and summarized for the
first time at the ACWI 2002 annual meeting. ACWI member organizations requested more time for review and comment on the report before considering 
it for endorsement.
·	WICP will send the Streamgaging Report to all ACWI members for comment (sent by email May 9, 2002). 
·	Members were asked to provide written comments to Tom Yorke, SGTF Co-Chair by Mid-June, 2002 (several comments received).
·	Comments are currently being reviewed. Since most are editorial or informational, it does not appear that a Conference call will be needed. 
·	USGS is work with the Association of State Flood Plain Managers, to address some of their issues regarding the Report.
·	The Task Force will revise the Report and prepare a Response to comments.
·	The revised Report and Response will be sent out to all ACWI member organizations in late summer.
·	Formal approval by ACWI will be requested by email vote.

ACTION ITEM - Water Quality Data Elements (WQDE)
The Water Quality Data Elements, proposed by the Methods and Data Comparability
Board through the National Water Quality Monitoring Council, and adopted as voluntary standards at the FY 2001 ACWI meeting, are proposed for adoption as EPA Data Standards, per a recommendation of the Environmental Data Standards
Committee, a joint EPA-state committee. Comments will be received through a Federal Register Notice.

ACTION ITEM - National Environmental Methods Index (NEMI)
	The Alternate Chair of the ACWI, Robert M. Hirsch, Associate Director for Water at the 
	U.S. Geological Survey; and James Hanlon, then Acting Administrator of Water at the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, agreed to co-sign a letter in conjunction with the
Public release of the NEMI. NEMI was proposed by the Methods and Data 
Comparability Board, through the National Water Quality Monitoring Council, and was unanimously 
adopted at the FY 2001 ACWI meeting. The database had since been populated with over X00 methods, 
from the USGS, USEPA, Waste Management Institute, and various other Federal and private sector laboratories, 
under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement.

ACTION ITEM - Tribal Communications
	ACWI members, both Federal agencies and non-governmental organizations, were asked
	to assist the National Water Quality Monitoring Council to facilitate communications on 
	with Tribal organizations on water quality monitoring, by providing access to existing
networks and mailing lists. Suggestions and offers of support were received from several
ACWI member organizations, including:
·	U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
·	DOI Bureau of Reclamation, 
·	American Water Works Association, 
·	Water Environment Federation, 
·	Conservation Technology Information Center, and 
·	National Association of Counties; and from the
·	Intertribal Council of Arizona, through the National Water Quality Monitoring Council.
The WICP will work with these organizations to increase communications to and encourage 
participation of the tribes regarding ACWI-sponsored activities, especially:
·	Training opportunities at the 4th National Monitoring Conference (2004)
·	Participation in State and Regional Monitoring Councils
·	Distribution of resource materials on monitoring

ACTION ITEM - Water Issues for Homeland Security 

Consider an ACWI-sponsored forum on The Science and Technology for Water 
Security, focusing on research and development, new technologies, and tools -
both available and needed - to protect water infrastructure and water
information.

ACTION ITEM - Consideration of a Possible Fall/Winter Meeting of the ACWI
	The ACWI members expressed interest in the possibility of an additional meeting in the late fall or winter of 2003, depending on availability of resources, to continue to address developing recommendations and topics of interest, including:
·	Implementation of the Recommendations of the Cooperative Water Program, especially regarding the appropriate role of the Federal sector in activities in which the private sector is also engaged (e.g., Total Maximum Daily Loads, Flood Forecasting and Mapping).
·	Approval and implementation of the Recommendations of the ACWI Streamgaging Task Force regarding a National Streamflow Information Program.
·	Update and next steps on enhanced Tribal communications.
·	Reports from the 3rd National Monitoring Conference (May 2002), the 1st Sustainable Water Resources Roundtable (Oct 2002?), and the 2nd TMDL Science and Policy Conference (Nov 2002).
·	Special Interest Issues including:
o	Water Security
o	Drought and Fire
o	Ecosystem and Human Health

established three work groups to help prepare for its next meeting and 
to help focus subsequent discussions on three specific topics:
1) biotechnology budget priorities;2) topics for potential investigation 
on the impacts of biotechnology through the Economic Research Service 
and the National Agricultural Statistics Service; and 3) potential 
topics for study by the National Research Council's Standing Committee
on Biotechnology, Food and Fiber Production, and the Environment.  
These work groups produced frameworks used for further discussion by 
the ACAB as a whole at the second ACAB meeting, on July 26-27, 2000, 
and therefore these workgroup meetings themselves were not subject 
to the FACA.  For completeness, all of the workgroups met via 
teleconference on July 6 or July 7, 2000. In addition, The Economics 
work group and the budget group met in person on July 25, 2000 as well.  
These work groups may meet in the future as further discussions on 
these topics are called for.

The membership on these work groups is as follows:
Budget:  Carolyn Brickey, James Dodson, David Frederickson, Thomas Hoban,
Marjorie Hoy, Mark Lipson, Bruce McEvoy, Margaret Mellon, Philip Nelson, 
Austin Sullivan, David Winkles

Economics and Data: Jeffrey Burkhardt, Carol Tucker Foreman, Sharan Lanini, 
Mary-Howell Martens, Marshall Martin, Lorraine Nakai, Roger Pine, C.S. Prakash,
Frank Sims, Michael Sligh, Jerry Slocum, Michael Yost

Standing Committee Issues:  Dale Bauman, Daniel Botkin, James Cook, Rebecca 
Goldburg, Michael Hansen, Neil Harl, Chuck Johnson, Anne Kapuscinski, Ed Korwek,
Cal McCastlain, Carol Nottenburg, Virginia Weldon, Margaret Wittenberg.

At the third ACAB meeting, on November 29-30, 2000, a work group was 
established to help the ACAB consider the role of the public sector in
 plant breeding in the 21st century, and draft a report to be 
considered by the ACAB on this topic.  The members of this work 
group were: Cal McCastlain, Chuck Johnson, Mary-Howell Martens, 
Marshall Martin, Margaret Mellon, Michael Sligh, and James Cook.
This work group met by teleconference on March 16, 2001, May 16, 2001, 
July 2, 2001, and July 23, 2001.  All work of this work group (i.e.,
various drafts of the report leading up to the adoption of the consensus 
report on August 1, 2001) was reported back to the full ACAB for its 
consideration, and therefore the work of this work group, and all the 
other ACAB work groups as well) is not subject to FACA meeting requirements.  
This was a main topic of discussion at the third, fourth, and fifth ACAB 
meetings, with consensus on the report being reached at the fifth meeting.

At the fourth ACAB meeting, on April 17-18, 2001, there was detailed discussion
on the economic and legal aspects of gene flow from transgenic plants to 
other plants, a topic of continuing discussion. Between the fourth and fifth 
ACAB meetings, another work group was constituted to help frame the continuing 
discussion at the fifth plenary session on this topic.  The members of this 
work group were: Frank Sims, C. S. Prakash, Margaret Wittenberg, Neil Harl, 
Rich Lotstein, Ed Korwek, Phil Nelson, Margaret Mellon, and Mary-Howell Martens.  
This work group met via teleconference on July 19, 2001 and developed 
a draft framework for a letter on the subject of gene flow to be sent 
by the Chair of the ACAB to Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman apprising 
her of the ACAB's deliberations and the importance the ACAB attaches to
the subject.  This draft was considered at the August 1-2, 2001, ACAB meeting.
Ultimately, no consensus was reached on the text at the meeting.

The budget work group was scheduled to meet on July 16, 2001 to work
on framing the budget discussions at the upcoming ACAB meeting, but not 
enough members were available at that time for work to proceed.  However, 
at the fifth ACAB meeting, the Committee was able to develop a list of 
biotechnology budget priorities for USDA for FY 2003, and this information was 
subsequently transmitted by letter by the ACAB Chair to USDA Secretary Veneman.  
The text of the letter is available on the ACAB web site.

The NGRAC, a statutory committee, was established in March 1992, under the USDA Departmental Regulation 1043-8 as directed by Section 1632 of P.L. 101-624 of the 1990 Farm Bill. Its charter was last renewed in March 1999 and expired in March 2001.  The NGRAC is appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture, and its duties are solely advisory to the Secretary and the Director of the National Genetic Resources Program (NGRP) on matters concerning the NGRP, established by the U.S. Congress to: acquire, characterize, preserve, document, and distribute to scientists germplasm of all life forms important for food and agricultural production. The NGRAC responds to the important issues of the nation in respect to conserving and utilizing genetic resources for food and agriculture. It meets twice a year, and can consist of up to nine members appointed by the Secretary and seven or more ex-officio members. Two-thirds of the appointed members represent the scientific disciplines relevant to NGRP, and one-third represent the general public in relevant activities. Thus, it is likely that each of the life forms in NGRP (plants, forest species, animals, aquatics, insects, and microbes) is represented by only one appointed scientific member.  The most recent meeting of the NGRAC was in August 1999 in Washington, D.C.Five new members were newly appointed in September 2000. The NGRAC’s most recent recommendations to the Department and the Program are included on its web page at http://www.ars-grin.gov/ngrac/

Currently, the NGRAC is inactive, pending rechartering.  New members must be appointed, or current members reappointed.  It would meet at least once, and perhaps twice, in 2003, likely in the mid-late spring, and early autumn. The agenda for such meeting would, of course, be strongly determined by the chair and members, but the following issue would likely merit high priority for discussion: 1) international genetic resource treaties and agreements, e.g., the International Treaty for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture; 2) review of USDA’s progress with acting on the previous NGRAC recommendation to the USDA and the NGRP to develop a road map (more explicit in relevant content than the broad Agricultural Research Service Six-Year Plan) and strategic plan for its genetic resources and genomics programs; 3) review of activities of other Advisory Committees, in particular those that deal with genetic resources, such as the ones on Agricultural Biotechnology (ACAB) and Invasive Species; 4) review of current budgets and fiscal status of USDA genetic resource programs; 5) review recent domestic and international developments associated with the application of intellectual property rights protection to plant genetic resources.");

The recent restructuring of the IRS has brought with it a great deal of change.  IRS executives are working to reduce burden on America's taxpayers and consider their perspective in making decisions on policy and procedures.  The panel serves as a unique forum of private citizens.  They gather public input and can make recommendations based on the feedback and issues that they are hearing from taxpayers.  In addition, they can and have served as focus groups for IRS teams.  Since the panels are established with volunteers from a broad spectrum of backgrounds, their opinions are reflective of the opinions of the general taxpaying public.  Panel members have served as focus groups on a number of issues including:  notice and publication revisions (particularly for EITC); the dual notice initiative; the installment agreement annual notice; oral agreements; and Offers in Compromise.   

Executives from various Operating Divisions within the Internal Revenue Service have attended panel meetings providing input, answers and information on many open issues.  Panel members from all panels will attend high level executive planning meetings concerning issues such as: EIN, (Employer ID Numbers), Notice and Clarity Redesign, and Establishment of Kiosks to better service the taxpaying public. Panel members have been included in the problem solving process for a number of elevated issues and have established a direct contact with the agency owners of the processes designed to correct or improve service. 
The following are just a few examples of areas where the panels have cooperated with the Operating Divisions in affecting positive change.  The New York panel made recommendations for modifying the format of Small Business Workshops.  They suggested that the workshops be broken down into individual modules so that participants could pick and choose which segments they needed to attend; and to offer modules during evening hours.  The local office adapted these recommended changes, which have been very favorably received by the business owners in the community.  As a result of links with Customer Service the Pacific-Northwest panel was instumental in the creation of a computerized fill--in form for substitute W-2s.  In the past, Customer Service Representatives (CSRs) maintained the paper forms at their desks and completed them by hand.  The fill-in form will save time and provide the taxpayer a professional, legible copy.  IRS executives agree to continue this type of dialogue for filing season readiness issues.

The Midwest panel continues to advocate for increased face-to-face services, through mobile-based services, multilingual services, and customer driven hours of operation and location. A Midwest CAP recommendation concerning the timeliness of estate tax closing letters, was influential in decisions by an IRS Redesign team to centralize the processing of estate and gift tax returns. At the invitation of the Employer Identification Number (EIN) Improvement Team, the Midwest panel worked directly with the IRS to improve the service provided by Tele-TIN and simplify the Form SS-4, ""Application for Employer Identification Number"".  The Florida panel recommended a checkbox allowing limited representation by the return preparer which was implemented by the Service for the Year 2000 filing season.  Additional efforts by the Florida panel have resulted in linkages with the Wage and Investment and Small Business Self Employed Operating Divisions for improvements to field services to taxpayers, toll free telephone improvements and notice and forms clarity and redesign.");

We need the younger people so let’s make it easier for them to be a representative.”

   VA COMMENT:  Approved.  A minimum of four VAVS meetings is required by current Veterans Health Administration (VHA) policy.  The composition of the local VAVS Committee is changing due to age and declining health of the current local VAVS Committee members.  Younger committee members are often employed and unable to attend VAVS meetings held during the day.  Local management should be encouraged to hold one evening VAVS Committee meeting to accommodate those members who are employed.

   b.  RECOMMENDATION:  “At VAMC’s and other VA facilities where VA staff and employees are provided with photo/picture identification [ID], volunteers [without compensation employees] should be furnished the same type of positive ID.  This form of ID will not only add to the total security of all VA facilities where volunteers are serving, it will enhance the overall well being of both in [patient] and outpatient veterans, VA staff and all volunteers.  Furthermore, in cases where volunteers are serving veterans outside the VA facilities, in the local community and in veterans’ homes, the picture ID will give them legitimacy.”

   VA COMMENT:  Approved.  VA volunteers are considered “without compensation” employees (WOC).  Most facilities require picture identification to enter the buildings.  If facilities require VA employees and contractors to have VA-issued picture ID’s, then VA volunteers should receive them as well.
 
   c.  RECOMMENDATION:  “There is a need for staff training and preparation for new volunteers at outpatient clinics.  Volunteers who go to the clinic should have an opportunity for orientation on the premises as well as a variety of available positions to serve the veterans who visit the clinics.”

   VA COMMENT:  Approved.  VA volunteers are considered WOC employees and are required to receive the proper orientation and service-specific training by the utilizing service.  If the volunteer is assigned to an outpatient clinic, an orientation must be provided by the staff at the clinic.  Staff are encouraged to maximize the utilization of VA volunteers to enhance services provided to veterans.

The SRC agreed to host a workshop to bring together subsistence users, Nondalton Tribal Council , NPS, ADF&G and other resource managers to talk about subsistence eligibility,  Port Alsworth Resident Zone, NPS wood cutting policy and the status of 9(B) caribou and moose populations. 

The SRC made the following comments and recommendations on proposed 2005 Federal subsistence fisheries proposals: 

Proposal 1 - Allow the sale of handicrafts made from brown bear fur: The term, “grizzly” is not used in the Lake Clark area to describe brown bears. The SRC suggested that the reference be changed to “brown/grizzly” bears to recognize regional differences in how people refer to brown bears.

Proposal 42 - SRC supported the proposal to revise the bull caribou harvest limit in Units 9(B), 17 and 18. 

Proposal 43 - The SRC took no action on this proposal because same-day airborne hunting is not permitted on National Park Service lands and the proposal would not affect caribou hunting in Lake Clark National Park or Preserve.

Proposal 44: Allow same day airborne hunting of moose in Units 9 and 17. The SRC decided to take no action on Proposal 44 for the same reasons as for Proposal 43. Same-day airborne hunting is not permitted on National Park Service lands.

Proposal 48: The SRC supported the proposal to establish a beaver hunting season on Federal public lands in Unit 9(B).

With the close advice and support of the Committee, the Department of State continues to work out with the CIA, NSC, and other agencies new procedures for expanding the Foreign Relations series to include previously highly-classified and sensitive intelligence documentation. These procedures go far to ensuring the full implementation of the statutory mandate to publish a Foreign Relations series that is ""complete and accurate."" The Committee advises on reform and modernization of the preparation and publication of volumes in the series, including use of the Internet.

Travel to the United States by international visitors comprises a vital part of American interactions with the world. These interactions depend upon the United States consistently processing visas in a timely and consistent manner. Despite added staff and new communication efforts to explain stricter procedures, negative perceptions of our visa process persist. 

A recent Times of London editorial headline asked; “There's much confusion about changes to visa rules.  So will you need a tourist visa on your next American holiday?” Similar headlines appear in newspapers around the globe, contributing to the belief that America discourages even the most legitimate and beneficial visitors.

The Commission recommends the establishment of a fast-track visa procedure to accommodate travelers who meet national security criteria.

Because of real or perceived problems, overall visa applications are significantly reduced. The International Institute of Education reports international student intake, which had been increasing at more than 10 percent per year for over a decade, demonstrated less than a one percent growth in the past year. Students from the Middle East were down 10 percent from the previous year, with decreases of 25 percent each from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and 15 percent from the United Arab Emirates. Additionally, this Commission’s independent interviews with visa applicants reveal that despite socio-economic background, purpose (i.e. U.S. government invitees to exchange programs), benevolence, record, or frequency of travel, interlocutors complain that difficulties, long waits, and cumbersome processes remain.

America’s historic influence with international business leaders, students, and other visitors will be lost unless we balance our visa policies with our security concerns.

Educational Exchanges and Cultural Programs

The Commission recommends Congress authorize funding for the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs to foster and track relationships with exchange participants who are funded by the United States government.  

The government’s long-term communications efforts, which include our professional, cultural, and student exchanges, are among the Department of State’s most effective initiatives.  These programs are expensive, but worthwhile if participants are selected strategically.  We often do not see results until at least 10 years into the future.  To further utilize our exchange programs as advocacy tools, participants must be engaged in an evolving relationship with the United States.  After they return to their countries, they should regularly interact with the United States. This will help promote our national interests and keep participants engaged.

Congress should authorize and encourage the Department of State to actively recruit and encourage businesses and cultural and educational institutions to bring international visitors to the United States and send Americans abroad.

The number of professional, cultural, and student exchanges facilitated by the government every year are minimal in comparison to what the private sector can accomplish.  Thus, Congress should direct and authorize funding for the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs to serve as a catalyst for private sector exchanges. Additionally, Congress should encourage the Department of State to use a portion of its cultural budget to involve the private sector to fund more cultural exhibits. These programs can build an understanding of our culture and values, which fosters long-term relationships with this nation as a whole.

Broadcasting

The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) must have a process for officially graduating, selling, or canceling its services and broadcast stations once target markets have progressed toward an open society. Congress should authorize funding for this process. 

The Broadcasting Board of Governors’ resources are limited relative to the scope of the agency’s mandate.  Every week, millions of people tune into the BBG’s programming.  Its broadcasts are reaching vast new audiences in the Middle East.  To expand broadcasting to Arab and Muslim audiences, the Governors curtailed services to Eastern Europe and other emerging democracies.  Given the lack of alternative options, the Commission believes that the BBG made the right decision.  The Commission, however, underlines the importance of continued programming in emerging democracies if there is lack of American presence. This can have long term and significant effects. 

The BBG must discern how to reach large audiences in complex, competitive media environments worldwide with straight news, as well as perspectives on American culture and official U.S. government policies. Its services should communicate positive values and culture through local languages.  The BBG should be able to direct its time, talents, and resources to only the most important and relevant areas of broadcasting by evaluating, then weaning itself of, services that no longer have a use or an audience.

Congress should authorize funding to accelerate multi-media and Internet development, infusing more emerging communications media into the BBG’s portfolio.  

It is essential that the BBG remain at the cutting edge of the communications field through dominant and emerging media in strategic regions for American foreign policy reach.  Television is the most effective medium for influencing large numbers of people. In the last decade, most of the world's population has secured access to this medium. However, the Internet is now surpassing television as the most effective and influential medium in many markets, particularly because of interactivity. The Committee should authorize funding for this Commission or the BBG to investigate, and report on initiatives that can enhance the availability of Internet services to young people in the Middle East. This more comprehensive approach would increase America’s foreign policy reach.

The AFEB has its origins in the Board for the Investigation and Control of Influenza and Other Epidemic Diseases in the Army. The Board was conceived at the beginning of World War II and established formally by the Secretary of War on January 11, 1941. When the Board was founded its mission had the following components: (1) to advise the Surgeon General on matters pertaining to preventive medicine; (2) to be prepared to investigate through laboratory and epidemiological study, outbreaks of infectious disease; and (3) to conduct laboratory and other types of research on the pathogenesis, spread, control, and prevention of diseases of concern to the Army. 

In 1946 the Board became known as the Army Epidemiological Board. The Board received its present designation, the AFEB, in 1949 and was given triservice responsibilities in the field of preventive medicine. In 1953, the AFEB was chartered under the Department of Defense. Under its initial charters the AFEB advised the Surgeons General and the Department of Defense, but also conducted and directed specific research programs through its Commissions. 

Subsequent to Congressional action sharply limited all advisory committees within the Executive Branch, the AFEB was dissolved on December 31, 1972 and recreated under a revised charter on January 3, 1973. The mission of the AFEB was directed to scientific and technical advice and assistance; the Board's responsibility for the conduct and oversight of field investigations and contract research was eliminated. 

The current charter assigns the AFEB the responsibility to consider medical issues as they may relate to operations, policy, and research and development, and include, but are not necessarily limited to, preventive medicine, occupational and environmental health, and health promotion programs. The AFEB prepares findings and makes recommendations based on technological and epidemiological principles to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs and the Surgeons General of the Military Services.

The Board currently considers and makes formal recommendations on approximately 10-15 issues annually.  This service is provided without compensation, requires approximately 30 person days or 240 hours of consultant time per recommendation, and is conservatively estimated to save the Department over $1.08 to 1.62 million.  

The impact of Board recommendations can be immediate and significant.  In a series of adopted recommendations on accession health issues, independent and evidence-based analysis by the AFEB allowed barriers in the officer accession process that had existed for over 30 years to be removed.  This series of in-depth reviews resulted in elimination of needless screening practices that is projected to save over $6 million annually.  By leveraging the expertise of the AFEB to assist the Department in arriving at these accession policy decisions, approximately one year was eliminated from the review and recommendation process and the Department saved an estimated $1.5 million.

1) Education: Institutionalize a bilingual environmental and environmental health education campaign throughout border-region school systems and community groups.  Directly involve children and their families as educators and program implementers.
2) Research: Foster collaboration across border-region academic institutions, health organizations, and environmental agencies.  Step up research, data gathering, and data analysis of border-region children's environmental health issues as the foundation for informed strategic actions.
3) Actions for children:  Support environmental health programs and projects in border-region settings that especially benefit children as an age group.
4) Actions for all age groups:  Continue to support border-region environmental infrastructure projects, called for by the Good Neighbor Environmental Board in its previous reports, that benefit all age groups.");

from the March 4, 2004 meeting

1.	MACOSH recommends that the health workgroup collect additional hexavalent chromium data from maritime interests and provide the data to OSHA.  The health workgroup will try to provide data by March 30, with a deadline of April 15.  The data may include exposure monitoring, injuries and illnesses, costs, and abatement control measures.  The additional data will be used by OSHA as it develops the hexavalent chromium standard for the maritime industry.

2.	MACOSH recommends that OSHA propose a hexavalent chromium rule for maritime that is not combined with the general industry proposed rule.  The rule should be similar to the separate rule being considered for construction, allowing OSHA to tailor the rule to the maritime work environment.

3.	MACOSH recommends OSHA produce a traffic safety guidance product for the longshore industry to help employers and employees reduce traffic accidents and injuries.  The guidance product would be most useful in the form of an e-tool that can be used on the Internet.

4.	MACOSH recommends that the safety culture workgroup conduct a pilot project with maritime interests to determine the most common root causes of maritime accidents.  MACOSH will develop two lists of the 15 most common root causes, one for longshoring and the other for shipyards.

5.	MACOSH recommends that OSHA develop a standard to require vessels to provide guardrails on platforms where longshore workers are lashing and unlashing containers, and performing other work, in order to reduce fall injuries.

6.	MACOSH recommends that OSHA develop a longshore standard to require fall protection when employees are inside a cage being lifted by a crane.  Employers should be required to install anchor points at a low point in the cage, and employees must tie off to the anchor points to reduce fall injuries.

7.	MACOSH recommends OSHA produce a guidance product for the longshore industry outlining safety and health training issues for maintenance and repair staff.  The guidance product should include mandatory training under OSHA’s longshore standards, and recommend training commonly used by shipyard employers for maintenance and repair workers.  The guidance product would be most useful in the form of an e-tool that can be used on the Internet.

8.	MACOSH recommends that OSHA continue to develop alliances in the maritime industry, with appropriate union involvement.  MACOSH further recommends that OSHA support regional alliance meetings with maritime and other interests to allow alliances to network on safety and health matters and facilitate the sharing of safety and health best practices information between alliances.

9.	MACOSH recommends that OSHA complete the six Safety and Health Injury Prevention Sheets (SHIPS) currently in development, and fund additional SHIPS for the longshore industry.  MACOSH should provide input on the subject matter and priority of additional SHIPS.

10.	MACOSH recommends that OSHA produce safety and health e-tools for the longshore industry and set aside funding to update and maintain the shipyard e-tools.

MACOSH Recommendations to OSHA
From the June 30/July 1, 2004 meeting


1.	MACOSH recommends that, when the 29 CFR Part 1915 Subpart P fire protection standard is promulgated, OSHA update the shipyard e-tools using the assistance of the shipyard alliances.

2.	MACOSH, while recognizing the advantage of having automatic external defibrillating devices (AED’s) available where medical help is not available within 3-5 minutes, also recognizes the potential liability issues which may arise in certain states if an employer were to provide such devices.  MACOSH recommends that OSHA research the problem and enlist the help of the Solicitor’s Office or other appropriate office within the Department of Labor to draft appropriate legislation in the form of a national “good samaritan” statute to protect employers, employees or their agents from liability when using an AED in good faith to attempt to save the life of a cardiac victim.

3.	MACOSH recommends that OSHA update and republish Publication 2254 Training Requirements in OSHA Standards and Training Guidelines to correct errors in the references to 29 CFR Parts 1917 and 1918 section.

4.	MACOSH recommends that the Secretary of Labor recharter the advisory committee on October 1, 2004 to align the committee’s charter with the federal fiscal year.

Section V.d. of the Council's Charter requires that the Council report to the Department of State's Under Secretary for Management through the Council's Executive Secretary and specifies that the reporting method may be ""oral and/or written"".  The Council complies with this requirement through briefings on Council activities, issues, and recommendations, which the Executive Secretary provides on at least a monthly basis to the Department's Assistant Secretary for Administration.  The Assistant Secretary in turn reports the substance of these briefings to the Under Secretary for Management.  In addition, the Executive Secretary provides brief written summaries on each Council Annual and Executive Committee Meeting and other significant activities for inclusion in the Bureau of Administration's  Weekly Activity Report,which the Bureau provides to the Under Secretary for Management.  For example, the Executive Secretary recently submitted a written report on the participation of two American overseas schools in the Johnson & Johnson-sponsored summer training institute on drug & alcohol abuse prevention at Rutgers University in July 2005.  In addition, the Executive Secretary submitted a written report on a communication from the director of the Department-assisted American Community School, Amman, Jordan, that the Emergency Procedures Manual, developed by the Overseas Schools Advisory Council, was a valuable reference in responding to the concerns of students and staff after the terrorist bombings on November 9, 2005.  The director used the manual as a guide to providing information and emotional support, for which many teachers and parents expressed appreciation.  The Council had  distributed the manual to American overseas schools and to U.S. diplomatic posts in 2003, posted it on the Department’s Intranet at http://aopros.a.state.gov, and is considering updating and reissuing it in 2006.

While the Council has no subcommittees per se, it does have an Evaluation Committee, composed of four members that the Council Chair appoints.  The membership of the Evaluation Committee includes the Council Chair, at least one of the Vice Chairs, and two other Council members.  The Evaluation Committee reviews educational improvement/enhancement proposals for American overseas schools, which the Overseas Schools Regional Associations submit for Council sponsorship.  After completing these reviews, the Evaluation Committee makes recommendations on the proposals to the full Council for consideration.  The full Council then accepts, rejects, modifies, or defers  the Evaluation Committee's recommendations.  In addition the Council established two ad hoc committees this year -  one on communications and one on fundraising.  The Communications Committee implemented a website through Council member, AOL, to improve communications among members about Council activities and business.  The Fundraising Committee is considering a variety of ways to improve the Council's fundraising efforts that support its annual Educational Assistance Program.");

The AFEB has its origins in the Board for the Investigation and Control of Influenza and Other Epidemic Diseases in the Army. The Board was conceived at the beginning of World War II and established formally by the Secretary of War on January 11, 1941. When the Board was founded, its mission had the following components: (1) to advise the Surgeon General on matters pertaining to preventive medicine; (2) to be prepared to investigate through laboratory and epidemiological study, outbreaks of infectious disease; and (3) to conduct laboratory and other types of research on the pathogenesis, spread, control, and prevention of diseases of concern to the Army. 

In 1946 the Board became known as the Army Epidemiological Board. The Board received its present designation, the AFEB, in 1949 and was given triservice responsibilities in the field of preventive medicine. In 1953, the AFEB was chartered under the Department of Defense. Under its initial charters the AFEB advised the Surgeons General and the Department of Defense, but also conducted and directed specific research programs through its Commissions. 

Subsequent to Congressional action sharply limited all advisory committees within the Executive Branch, the AFEB was dissolved on December 31, 1972 and recreated under a revised charter on January 3, 1973. The mission of the AFEB was directed to scientific and technical advice and assistance; the Board's responsibility for the conduct and oversight of field investigations and contract research was eliminated. 

The current charter assigns the AFEB the responsibility to consider medical issues as they may relate to operations, policy, and research and development, and include, but are not necessarily limited to, preventive medicine, occupational and environmental health, and health promotion programs. The AFEB prepares findings and makes recommendations based on technological and epidemiological principles to the Secretary of Defense through the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs and the Surgeons General of the Military Services.

The impact of Board recommendations can be immediate and significant.  In a series of adopted recommendations on accession health issues, independent and evidence-based analysis by the AFEB allowed barriers in the officer accession process that had existed for over 30 years to be removed.  This series of in-depth reviews resulted in elimination of needless screening practices that is projected to save over $6 million annually.  By leveraging the expertise of the AFEB to assist the Department in arriving at these accession policy decisions, approximately one year was eliminated from the review and recommendation process and the Department saved an estimated $1.5 million.

NOTE: Subcommittee meetings are held in conjunction with committee meetings and, as such, the costs associated with the subcommittee meetings cannot be separated from the overall costs to committee meetings. Subcommittees provide comments and recommendations to the full AFEB during open session.  After deliberation by the full AFEB, formal written comments and recommendations are provided to DoD by the committee.  The committee maintains and archives all financial data in accordance with DoD and National Archives and Records Administration standards.

Integrating environmental justice considerations into the Agency’s outreach activities, public policies, science, data collection, regulatory, enforcement, and compliance decisions is difficult and the Agency has sought input from the various multi-stakeholder entities that comprise the NEJAC.  The Agency has determined that receiving input from all affected stakeholders is essential.

Because the EPA is a regulatory agency with responsibilities for, among other things, issuing regulations and enforcing the environmental laws that it administers, the Agency’s actions may be considered to be controversial in nature to one or more of the stakeholder groups.

     The panel is divided into fourteen committees; seven  committees (Issue Committees) are working with IRS program owners on specific issues that potentially effect all taxpayers.  The issues were identified by the IRS operating divisions and are part of the operating divisions strategic plans, and objectives.  The recommendations that arise from these committees aid in shaping issues in the future. The issues addressed by these committees are:

The Board's most important role is that of an advisory and independent sounding board, furnishing constructive input to the University leadership and, from its founding, the Board has provided expert guidance on a range of vital academic issues and greatly contributed to the University’s education, outreach and research missions. 

At the same time, the Board serves as a guardian of institutional integrity, assisting the President to ensure the University continues to fulfill its stated mission.  To offer that level of support and challenge, if necessary, the Board must operate independently of the University, while maintaining open communication with both the President of the National Defense University and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

The Board continues to perform the role for which it was originally formed.  Since the establishment of the original Board in 1977, the University has grown considerably.  The Institute for National Strategic Studies (INSS) and the Information Resources Management College (IRMC) were established within NDU in 1984 and 1990 respectively.  In 1997 and 1998, the Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies (CHDS) and the Center for Defense Leadership and Management Program (CDLAMP) became part of NDU.  In 2002 CDLAMP became the School for National Security Executive Education (SNSEE) with Counterterrism Education as its core program. In 2004 the Institute for Homeland Security Studies was established with Homeland Security Education as its core program and the Center for Counterproliferation Research underwent a name change; its new name is ""the Center for Weapons of Mass Destruction; its core mission remains unchanged 

In 1998, under the terms of the Defense Reform Initiative (DRI), the Office of Net Assessment Corporate Fellows Program and the National Security Education Program (NSEP) joined the University.  In 2000, three additional elements were created and joined the University: the Near East-South Asia Center for Strategic Studies, the Africa Center for Strategic Studies, and the Center for Technology and National Security Policy.  The BOV serves all the new University components, as well as the original colleges.

Balanced membership is maintained on the Board.  Members represent a broad spectrum of expertise in government, business and education.  In addition, there is a balance between military and civilian national security practitioners, academicians and civilian leaders in public service and the private sector.

No existing staff or advisory committees can perform the Board's functions.  As in all highly regarded academic institutions, the observations, reviews and criticism of accomplished persons in various disciplines and professional backgrounds outside the faculty structure and government are needed to maintain a viable and forward looking educational program for senior students representing diverse professional backgrounds.

Accordingly, it is highly desirable to have an advisory board whose members have served at the highest levels of policy and decision-making in the Services, Federal Government, academia, and other realms, where they are recognized as top authorities in their field.
In February 1997, upon completion of an extended candidacy process, NDU received notification of accreditation by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.  Accreditation empowers the University to grant masters degrees to its senior college students upon their graduation.  One of the criteria established as a standard for accreditation (contained in the Commission on Higher Education's publication, Characteristics of Excellence in Higher Education) is that a university must have ""a governing board actively fulfilling its responsibilities of policy and resource development.""  In other words, since receiving re-accreditation in 2002, NDU's retention of a governing board, i.e., its Board of Visitors, was no longer discretionary.

The AFEB has its origins in the Board for the Investigation and Control of Influenza and Other Epidemic Diseases in the Army. The Board was conceived at the beginning of World War II and established formally by the Secretary of War on January 11, 1941. When the Board was founded, its mission had the following components: (1) to advise the Surgeon General on matters pertaining to preventive medicine; (2) to be prepared to investigate through laboratory and epidemiological study, outbreaks of infectious disease; and (3) to conduct laboratory and other types of research on the pathogenesis, spread, control, and prevention of diseases of concern to the Army. 

In 1946 the Board became known as the Army Epidemiological Board. The Board received its present designation, the AFEB, in 1949 and was given triservice responsibilities in the field of preventive medicine. In 1953, the AFEB was chartered under the Department of Defense. Under its initial charters the AFEB advised the Surgeons General and the Department of Defense, but also conducted and directed specific research programs through its Commissions. 

Subsequent to Congressional action sharply limited all advisory committees within the Executive Branch, the AFEB was dissolved on December 31, 1972 and recreated under a revised charter on January 3, 1973. The mission of the AFEB was directed to scientific and technical advice and assistance; the Board's responsibility for the conduct and oversight of field investigations and contract research was eliminated. 

The current charter assigns the AFEB the responsibility to consider medical issues as they may relate to operations, policy, and research and development, and include, but are not necessarily limited to, preventive medicine, occupational and environmental health, and health promotion programs. The AFEB prepares findings and makes recommendations based on technological and epidemiological principles to the Secretary of Defense through the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs and the Surgeons General of the Military Services.

The impact of Board recommendations can be immediate and significant.  In a series of adopted recommendations on accession health issues, independent and evidence-based analysis by the AFEB allowed barriers in the officer accession process that had existed for over 30 years to be removed.  This series of in-depth reviews resulted in elimination of needless screening practices that is projected to save over $6 million annually.  By leveraging the expertise of the AFEB to assist the Department in arriving at these accession policy decisions, approximately one year was eliminated from the review and recommendation process and the Department saved an estimated $1.5 million.

NOTE: Subcommittee meetings are held in conjunction with committee meetings and, as such, the costs associated with the subcommittee meetings cannot be separated from the overall costs to committee meetings. Subcommittees provide comments and recommendations to the full AFEB during open session.  After deliberation by the full AFEB, formal written comments and recommendations are provided to DoD by the committee.  The committee maintains and archives all financial data in accordance with DoD and National Archives and Records Administration standards.

PCPFS made approximately six major recommendations during FY 2006: 1. Recommended that the 50-year Anniversary of PCPFS be recognized and celebrated (1956-2006). 2.Recommended that the on-line interactive website for The President’s Challenge program be continuously evaluated and improved to increase physical activity among all Americans aged 6 and older. This recommendation was made to support and advance the physical activity pillar of the President’s Healthier US initiative. 3. Recommended that more public/private partnerships be formed to leverage the visibility of the PCPFS and the partnering organizations to promote the importance of physical activity, fitness and sports participation. 4. Recommended that additional science partnerships be formed. 5. Recommended that an event be launched to celebrate National Physical Fitness and Sports Month (“May Month”), 2006. 6) Recommended that PCPFS form four working groups to address a) Outreach; b) corporate fitness; c) youth/schools/community groups & special populations; d) recognition of individuals and organizations that have made major contributions to the field of physical activity & fitness. 

• Over 4 million Americans earned a presidential recognition award in FY 2006. • Over 30 thousand schools participated in the President’s Challenge program, and 109 State Champion Schools were honored and selected. • Since the launch of the interactive program Web site in July 2003, (www.presidentschallenge.org), over 500,000 unique visitors have been on the site, and over 300,000 individuals have signed up for the President’s Challenge online to track their physical activities. • Held third annual winter sports clinic (2004 in Wintergreen, Virginia and 2005 & 2006 in Libertyville, PA) for Winter Trails Day, with SnowSports Industries America’s “Winter Feels Good” campaign. • Held the third annual HealthierUS Fitness Festival (May, 2006) at RFK Stadium with eighty health and fitness participating organizations.• Following recommendations made at Council meetings, contacts were initiated with state and territorial governors through the HHS Regional Directors, generating increased interest in PCPFS programs and information resources. The Wisconsin Governor’s Challenge continued through '05 and '06, and has been used as a template for other states. • PCPFS produced four Research Digests, which translate the latest research on a high interest topic in the area of physical activity and sports medicine for health/fitness professionals and other interested citizens. • PCPFS continued distribution Rx -- Physical Activity: Take the President’s Challenge, with the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE). • Over 100 partnerships have been formed with corporations and organizations that are implementing the President’s Challenge program at the grassroots and/or national level. • Partnerships include: 1) “I Can Do It, You Can Do It ”, an initiative with the HHS Office on Disability, which uses the President’s Challenge Physical Activity and Fitness Awards program and pairs mentors with children with disabilities to encourage and increase their physical activity. Mentors provide guidance and instruction to youth with disabilities as they become and stay physically active.; 2) The CHEER Challenge with the Harlem Globetrotters and the Department of Education to promote the benefits of physical activity and character education to youth. 3) the “You Can” campaign of the Administration on Aging (AOA) has over 1,000 partners and utilizes the President’s Challenge as the physical activity tracking tool. 4) General Mills supports the President's Challenge Program in low SES schools; 5) HealthierUS Veterans with the Veterans Administration to promote the benefits of healthy lifestyles to veterans and their families. The PCPFS Science Board continued its work after initially being formed in ‘03 to review publications, offer feedback re: sports/physical activity clinics, and to serve as science experts for PCPFS publications and programs, including the President’s Challenge Physical Fitness Test. Eleven renowned exercise scientists served on this Board. • Three science partnerships were formed with National Sports & Conditioning Association (NSCA), National Athletic Trainers Association (NATA), and American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation & Dance Research Consortium. These three partnerships add to the existing partnership with American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) • PCPFS promoted outdoor recreation on public lands in conjunction with a Federal Interagency Work Group (the Recreation MOU: HHS, DOI; USDA Forest Service; Army Corps of Engineers). 

All recommendations have been fully implemented with success. 1) The 50-year anniversary was recognized by the President in a proclamation declaring May as National Physical Fitness & Sports Month. Over 300 50-year anniversary partners signed up as ""Get America Moving"" Partners. New Council members were appointed on May 24, 2006 during 50-year anniversary year. 2) President’s Challenge Web site continues to grow in # of participants, and advanced features have been added. 3) Over 100 partnerships are now formed with corporations and organizations that are implementing the President’s Challenge program and raising the awareness of physical activity benefits nationally. 3) Three additional science partnerships were formed with NSCA, NATA, and AAHPERD Research Consortium, adding to the existing partnership with American College of Sports Medicine. 4) The HealthierUS Fitness Festival at RFK Stadium brought together 80 participating organizations. HealthierUS Veterans Program was launched. Event increased the awareness of programs & resources, as well as the benefits of healthy lifesytles. 5) The third annual HealthierUS Fitness Festival was held at RFK Stadium on May 6, 2006. 6) Four working groups were formed with new Council members to address a) Outreach; b) corporate fitness; c) youth/schools/community groups & special populations; d) recognition of individuals and organizations that have made major contributions to the field of physical activity & fitness.

However, the Department had received several requests from Congress and members of the CFS community for senior level HHS management to provide a more formal response to the Committee's recommendations.  Therefore, the Assistant Secretary for Health, Dr. John Agwunobi, attended the CFSAC meeting that was held on July 17, 2006 to address the Committee and members of the CFS community who were present at the meeting.  Restating much of the information that already had been provided by CFSAC ex-officio members and in letters sent to respond to Congressional and/or public inquiries, Dr. Agwunobi gave assurance that the Department views CFS as an important public health concern and that HHS is committed to identfying and working with public health experts who are recognized in this area of public health concern to develop a viable approach to CFS.  Dr. Agwunobi stated that the Department has adopted a multifaceted approach in its efforts to properly address the issues and concerns related to this chronic illness.  The NIH and CDC share responsibility for development of the Department's efforts to address this public health concern.  These agencies are pursuing integrated, multidisciplinary research efforts related to CFS and are committed to further stimulating and encouraging such research. A formal written response to the Committee's recommendations also will be prepared and forwarded to the Committee Chair.

The Advisory Committee recommends to the Secretary of Agriculture, that while acknowledging the importance of maintaining individual confidentiality, that NASS be granted access to the National Animal Identification System for the purpose of producing statistical data summaries.   

2.	The Advisory Committee recommends to the Secretary of Agriculture that NASS work in collaboration with other USDA agencies to establish more direct links to agricultural data contained in other USDA websites.

3.	The Advisory Committee recommends to the Secretary of Agriculture that NASS work with the Office of the General Counsel and the Office of the Chief Information Officer, to modify the required “Warning” notification on its Electronic Data Reporting website.  NASS should make the “Warning” notification more user friendly in an effort to ease farmers concerns in reporting electronically.

4.	The Advisory Committee recommends that NASS establish a phone number for to respondents to contact multilingual operators, – especially Spanish for assistance in reporting for the Census of Agriculture.  NASS should also develop questionnaires in other languages, and again especially Spanish.  Also, NASS needs to hire indigenous enumerators to conduct data collection on Indian reservations for the Census of Agriculture. 

5.	The Advisory Committee recommends that a subcommittee consisting of Gene Nelson, Terry Francl, Lucy Meyring, Ron Plain, and Kitty Smith, study the need and feasibility of a National Equine survey.   If the feasibility of conducting a National Equine survey is justified by this subcommittee, it will enhance NASS’s ability to seek appropriation funding. 

6.	The Advisory Committee recommends that NASS conduct more in-depth research concerning the new question on the Census of Agriculture asking for data on the acres operated on an Animal Unit Month (AUM).  The current members felt that the wording of the AUM question might be misunderstood by operators and result in misreported data. (This same AUM question has also been added to the Agricultural Resources Management Survey ARMS)

7.	The Advisory Committee recommends that a subcommittee consisting of Terry Francl, Frank Howell, Doris Mold, Janice Gengenbach, and Kent Schescke to research the feasibility of conducting an Energy survey.  With the raising cost of energy and the increased use of crops to generate new alternative fuels, the committee felt that the importance of this survey would be of more importance than an organic follow-on survey. 

8.	The Advisory Subcommittee on Pesticide Data Usage, after meeting and studying the scope of the NASS pesticide and chemical use program, recommended that no changes to the current NASS program are advised at this time and that the subcommittee be discontinued.  

9.	The Advisory Committee recommends that the priority needs for the 2007 Census of Agriculture follow-on surveys are 1) Census of Horticulture; 2) Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey; and 3) Economics and Land Ownership Survey.  

10.	The Advisory Committee recommends that NASS request that the Government Printing Office add the Census of Agriculture to the “Essential Titles for Public Use in Paper Format”, to ensure this media is available to all federal depository and research libraries.  

11.	The Advisory Committee recommends that NASS continue its efforts in working with Community Based Organizations and with the New Mexico pilot project on Indian reservations, to improve overall coverage of small and minority operated farms in the 2007 Census of Agriculture.

12.	The Advisory Committee recommends that NASS consider the use of outside promotional consultants and external support endorsements in development of the 2007 Census of Agriculture campaign to encourage producer cooperation.");

The NGRAC, a statutory committee, was established in March 1992, under the USDA Departmental Regulation 1043-8 as directed by Section 1632 of P.L. 101-624 of the 1990 Farm Bill. Its charter was last renewed in March 1999 and expired in March 2001.  The NGRAC is appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture, and its duties are solely advisory to the Secretary and the Director of the National Genetic Resources Program (NGRP) on matters concerning the NGRP, established by the U.S. Congress to: acquire, characterize, preserve, document, and distribute to scientists germplasm of all life forms important for food and agricultural production. The NGRAC responds to the important issues of the nation in respect to conserving and utilizing genetic resources for food and agriculture. It meets twice a year, and can consist of up to nine members appointed by the Secretary and seven or more ex-officio members. Two-thirds of the appointed members represent the scientific disciplines relevant to NGRP, and one-third represent the general public in relevant activities. Thus, it is likely that each of the life forms in NGRP (plants, forest species, animals, aquatics, insects, and microbes) is represented by only one appointed scientific member.  The most recent meeting of the NGRAC was in August 1999 in Washington, D.C.Five new members were newly appointed in September 2000. The NGRAC’s most recent recommendations to the Department and the Program are included on its web page at http://www.ars-grin.gov/ngrac/

Currently, the NGRAC is inactive, pending rechartering.  New members must be appointed, or current members reappointed.  It would meet at least once, and perhaps twice, in 2004, likely in the mid-late spring, and early autumn. The agenda for such meeting would, of course, be strongly determined by the chair and members, but the following issue would likely merit high priority for discussion: 1) international genetic resource treaties and agreements, e.g., the International Treaty for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture; 2) review of USDA’s progress with acting on the previous NGRAC recommendation to the USDA and the NGRP to develop a road map (more explicit in relevant content than the broad Agricultural Research Service Six-Year Plan) and strategic plan for its genetic resources and genomics programs; 3) review of activities of other Advisory Committees, in particular those that deal with genetic resources, such as the ones on Agricultural Biotechnology and Invasive Species; 4) review of current budgets and fiscal status of USDA genetic resource programs; 5) review recent domestic and international developments associated with the application of intellectual property rights protection to plant genetic resources.");

Recommendations made during FY 2006:

October 2005:
RECOMMENDATION:
MOTION #1:  The Committee accepts the flowchart [of the process for adding conditions to the uniform panel] with the changes discussed as its process for nominations of conditions for newborn screening. 

February 2006:

No recommendations made

June 2006:
MOTION #1: The Committee accepts the nomination form dated 5/18/06 to be used by proponents of adding a condition to the ACMG uniform newborn screening panel as a blank form to be sent to an evidence-based review entity for review and modification by the Committee as needed.

DECISION #1: A small meeting with experts in evidence-based review, pediatrics, and rare genetic diseases, as well as some people from the Committee, will be convened soon (a) to review the  proposed form for nominating conditions to the Committee to evaluate for newborn screening; and (b) to develop a proposal for reviewing and grading evidence to take back to the Criteria Workgroup and then the full Committee with specific questions for consideration.  If possible, the meeting will be held in late summer 2006, so that the Criteria Workgroup is able to present a proposal to the Committee at its November 2-3, 2006 meeting.

DECISION #2:  The plan of the Laboratory Standards & Procedures Subcommittee for a study of the utility of routine second screens of newborns for CH and CAH will be sent electronically to Committee members so that they can comment on it within 2 weeks. If a majority of Committee members vote to approve the plan, the subcommittee will be authorized to proceed with the study.

DECISION #3:  The Education & Training Subcommittee will hold a conference call in the very near future to discuss the concept of a broad national campaign for newborn screening along the lines of CDC’s immunization campaigns.  

DECISION #4:  The proposal of the Followup & Treatment Subcommittee to have a 1-day facilitated meeting— perhaps in conjunction with the November 2006 or February 2007 Advisory Committee meeting—to develop a logic model that describes entire system of long-term followup for newborn screening will be sent electronically to Committee members so that they can comment on it.  If a majority of Committee members vote to approve the proposal, the subcommittee will be authorized to proceed with the meeting. 

DECISION #5: Over the next several months, Dr. Lloyd-Puryear and others will continue to work on the draft policies and procedures document for the Advisory  Committee and will incorporate Committee members’ suggestions

The National Water Quality Monitoring Council of ACWI provided a draft report to ACWI representatives on the design of a ""National Water Quality Monitoring Network for U.S. Coastal Waters and their Tributaries"". ACWI members were given a one-month period to submit written comments. Comments were received from 8 ACWI member organizations, and a revised report was produced, which ACWI member organizations voted unanimously to approve in April 2006. Inter-agency briefings by USGS, NOAA and EPA were presented to the Executive Offices of the President on April 5, 2006. The report was prepared at the request of the President’s Council on Environmental Quality and National Science and Technology Council, in response to Chapter 15 of the report of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy. The Monitoring Council also worked with ACWI member organizations to finalize registration and select papers and posters for a 5th National Monitoring Conference to be held in San Jose, California in May 2006. Over 400 abstracts and posters were selected for presentation, and registration has reached 650. 
The Final Report of the 2004 Task Force on the USGS Cooperative Water Program was approved, and the 2004 COOP Task Force was sunset. Four ACWI member organizations agreed to participation in an upcoming review of the USGS five-year plan for the Program. 
Copies of the Final version of the Preliminary Report of the Sustainable Water Resources Roundtable were distributed to ACWI members. ACWI agreed that the Roundtable should continue to complete, revise, and refine indicators for tracking sustainability of water resources.
ACWI members were given an overview of the 8 current vacancies on ACWI, and asked for any recommendations. Three suggestions were received. 
The Subcommittee on Hydrology received ACWI approval of their plan to proceed with revision of ""Guidelines for Determining Flood Flow Frequency, Bulletin 17B.
The Subcommittee on Spatial Water Data received approval to name a co-chair from EPA, and for a management steering committee for the watershed boundary effort to help oversee the work being done and drive the job to completion.
ACWI members agreed to work with the National Ground Water Association (NGWA) to develop a Terms of Reference for a possible ground water subgroup under ACWI, which was further discussed at a special session at the National Monitoring Conference in May 2006.

In our FY97 report, ONDCP explained that it does not employ personnel on a full-time basis as Committee staff, and therefore, no ""personnel payments"" as contemplated under 18(a) appear in the report.  GSA and ONDCP agreed that no personnel payments should be identified.  Item 19 of the same form requires that agencies estimate the amount of Federal staff support years associated with the reporting year and the projected amounts for the next fiscal year.  Although line 19 is described on the form as corresponding to the amount of such personnel payments in line 18, GSA advised ONDCP to identify an FTE equivalent associated with actual (and projected) time ONDCP employees engage in Committee-related activities.  The numbers indicated are consistent with this agreement.  The increase for the next reporting period are based on projected increase in Committee activity potentially out of the OMB clearance of the final report, the hours associated with clearing the two additional nominees, as well as the likelihood that additional nominations will be made.

Note that in item 11, the establishment authority is not that the Committee was authorized by law.  Rather, it is through ONDCP's agency authority.  Last year's report included this authority information, which was not accurately portrayed in the final report.  This section also has been locked, and could not be altered during this reporting period.

In our FY97 report, ONDCP explained that it does not employ personnel on a full-time basis as Committee staff, and therefore, no ""personnel payments"" as contemplated under 18(a) appear in the report.  GSA and ONDCP agreed that no personnel payments should be identified.  Item 19 of the same form requires that agencies estimate the amount of Federal staff support years associated with the reporting year and the projected amounts for the next fiscal year.  Although line 19 is described on the form as corresponding to the amount of such personnel payments in line 18, GSA advised ONDCP to identify an FTE equivalent associated with actual (and projected) time ONDCP employees engage in Committee-related activities.  The numbers indicated are consistent with this agreement.  The increase for the next reporting period are based on projected increase in Committee activity potentially out of the OMB clearance of the final report, the hours associated with clearing the two additional nominees, as well as the likelihood that additional nominations will be made.

Note that in item 11, the establishment authority is not that the Committee was authorized by law.  Rather, it is through ONDCP's agency authority.  Last year's report included this authority information, which was not accurately portrayed in the final report.  This section also has been locked, and could not be altered during this reporting period.

Note that section 16(a) identifies 1 report.  As discussed in item 20(c), the report is in the OMB Clearance process, and has not received final approval.  Subsection 16 could not be amended to reflect that no report has gone final.");

The Board was given additional responsibilities to evaluate and review protocols of REE programs under the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act (AREERA) of 1998.  This legislation broadened the Board's obligations concerned with stakeholder input, priority setting, and accountability issues.  The Board reflects the interests of stakeholders nationwide and provides advice vital to the current and future success of food, forestry, and agricultural programs.  The Board has already made significant contributions with recommendations on the following: Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) and the Research, Education, and Economics (REE) Strategic and Performance Plans; REE priority setting and policies; merit and peer review procedures; relevancy and adequacy of funding of REE programs; and public communication. The Advisory Board continually solicited stakeholder input and made changes to their recommendations on priorities and funding accordingly, and gave advice on high priority topics of public interest, such as Agricultural Biotechnology, Food and Nutrition, Cutting-Edge Science and Technology, Review of Agricultural Chemicals, and the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems.  The Board has recommended the advancement of direct and long-term research funding and supported legislation to further address critical research areas. The breadth of agricultural research issues and the Board's broadened activites under the 1998 AREERA legislation, require efficient and thorough review and analyses, which are most effectively done with working groups/ad hoc committees in a teamwork approach that utilitizes a continuous mechanism of input, review, recommendations and feedback.  With the increased number of meetings required to address Board requirements, the use of conference calls has been successful and cost effective. Focus sessions during full Board meetings highlight the scientific basis of agricultural research and explore new avenues of research and education for the public good.  Reports and publications serve as important resources for USDA, congressional, and public information.  They provide annual updates; reflect broad stakeholder views; and highlight critical food, forestry, and agricultural research, education, and extension activities.  Readers can understand emerging issues, agricultural research needs, and recognize the many public benefits resulting from Federal investments. The Board requires two general Advisory Board meetings, one national stakeholder symposium, and at least one special ""listening session"" yearly in order to fulfill its mandate.  Recommendations by the Advisory Board to the Secretary of Agriculture have, to date, been considered useful by USDA in its ongoing policy and priority setting deliberations.  This Advisory Board should remain fully funded to assure the continued work of this vital Board and to ensure that stakeholder input contributes to the efficient and effective management of the Federal funding for agricultural research, extension, education, and economic programs.");

BIFAD Foundational Perspectives and Vision

Agriculture remains the basic underlying engine for economic development, health improvement, poverty reduction, reduction of conflict and increased international stability, the empowerment of women, child survival and nutrition, natural resource management and the environment.  Thus, agriculturally-based projects offer opportunities for multiple payoffs along all these dimensions.  Effective policies and projects will be those that are carefully matched to the specific circumstances of national settings.  Data indicate sufficient differences across developing country economic dynamics to indicate that policies crafted on broad generalities will not yield desired results.  At least a dozen categories of different economic dynamics can be identified. Thus, in developing useful policies, countries must be considered on a disaggregated basis.  U.S. universities have contributed specific skills to the development assistance effort, with proven results:  They represent a capacity for education, including curriculum development and educational technologies, and major capacities in research and education in the biological, social, agricultural, health and environmental sciences.  They have a proven capacity to extend knowledge to private sector, and to help build the public sector.  U.S. universities are globalizing along all dimensions of their work.  University alumni facilitate partnerships and collaborations with all sectors of developing countries. The knowledge base for development activity is broadly shared among a network of institutions which include the U.S. universities and European research centers, but extends beyond them to national and international institutions which have been evolving toward substantial capacity for twenty years.  These international and national agriculture research centers already contribute importantly to the research base and offer sites where robust partnerships across institutions and disciplines could be extended further. Effective leadership is evolving toward new forms of collaboration and teamwork as groups seek to manage multi-institutional, multi-sectoral projects.  Multiple concurrent working relationships are becoming the norm along with a growing recognition of the need to knit together a broad base of institutional expertise to address social and economic issues. Industrialized and developing countries share many of the same challenges in managing their natural resources and the environment, helping farming families in rural areas, and seeking appropriate distribution of economic returns.  We have a great deal to learn from one another; strategies developed in either setting may have applicability in the other. With these perspectives in mind, the BIFAD makes the following recommendations to the leadership of the Agency for International Development.  In all cases, current projects should be examined for consistency with the recommendation, and encouraged to evolve toward the new emphasis.

Recommendation 1

Focus on integrating projects across disciplines, using agriculture as an organizing element.  Seek projects results along both individual dimensions, such as agriculture productivity or child nutrition, as well as across dimensions, e.g., the production of foods which contribute directly to the local diet and nutritional needs of children and women.
 
 Recommendation 2

Involve multiple sector interests wherever possible, and focus the Agency's input on public goods.  At the same time that there is a great need to utilize the capacities of local government and private sector organizations, recognize that these institutions naturally have a more narrow definition of desirable results, and that the Agency is in a unique position to focus on issues and problems that cross national boundaries and economic sectors and which fall into a category better described as public goods.

Recommendation 3

Utilize, incorporate, collaborate with the CG network, IARCs, and NARS.  Aim to develop an international distance learning network associated with US universities which integrate these centers.

Recommendation 4

Identify and develop a half-dozen highly visible integrative projects which recognize and exploit the parallels between U.S. settings and settings in the developing world.  Using social systems as the parallel, such as rural farming, or physical systems, such as the parallels between managing natural park resources such as Yellowstone and the Serengeti, frame and manage the projects so that the benefits to all parties are clearly identifiable, and so that all interested sectors contribute to and benefit from the knowledge gained.  Major comparative projects may be an effective variation on this theme.

Recommendation 5

Engage with the university community in communicating the importance of these efforts to Congress.  Direct Congressional attention to the essentially integrative nature of development efforts, and to the multi-faceted benefits that they yield for both the developing world, and the industrialized world.

The panel serves as a unique forum of private citizens focused on gathering public input and providing recommendations for service improvements directly to the Secretary of the Treasury, the IRS Commissioner, and the National Taxpayer Advocate.

The IRS, in an effort to reduce burden on America’s taxpayers, announced the Checkbox Initiative in response to requests from IRS external stakeholders and the South Florida citizen panel.  This initiative alone will save an estimated 75,000 hours initially for taxpayers and their representatives by not having to prepare a third party authorization. We expect over a million taxpayers to use the checkbox feature in lieu of filing a Form 2848 (Power of Attorney and Declaration of Representative). The burden reduction will increase dramatically when one considers the 9.1 million notices related to math errors and return preparation that were issued in 1999. IRS estimates that taxpayers will save approximately 779 thousand hours by referring notices to their designees rather than responding to the IRS in writing or by telephone.  The Midwest advisory panel has asked IRS to consider extending this initiative to a sundry of business tax returns.

The Brooklyn Panel was instrumental in installing a multi-language kiosk in the Queens Public Library, which provides answers to more than 100 frequently asked tax questions and gives taxpayers the opportunity to print commonly used forms.
The questions and answers are available in English, Spanish, Russian, Korean and Chinese, which are the more common of the 42 languages identified in that community alone.

The Pacific-Northwest panel worked closely with the IRS Small Business Lab to purchase software and hardware to assist in developing a database of frequently asked question on the IRS web site.  The panel serves, as a reactor group to review questions and responses to ensure the average taxpayer understands the replies.  They are also commended for recommending change to the Publication 594, IRS Collection Process, to include explanatory language about lien and lien payoffs which was adopted by the Service and is included in this years revision.

The Midwest panel brought improved customer service to 2,688 taxpayers who otherwise may not have received service during the filing season.  The panel formally submitted its recommendations after meeting with the IRS filing season readiness team.  Local IRS executives agreed and expanded service to non-traditional sites and combined non-traditional sites with mobile tax assistance as well as increasing bilingual service.

The Committee is charged with advising HHS, through the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Minority Health, on the development of goals and specific program activities for improving the health of racial and ethnic minority groups.  In responding to this charge, the Committee decided to re-review the four specific minority health priorities which they had previously selected to develop a recommendations: (1)Native American health (including ""indigenous"" peoples of the U.S. and the Pacific Islands), (2) educational outreach and health promotion, (3) the role of information technology in health care, and (4)impact issues.  Because of its small membership size the Committee decided to develop a recommendation report per health topic/priority area to address existing health disparities that impact racial and ethnic minorities; rather than to work on developing four recommendation reports simultaneously. Consequently, the four subcommittees were dissolved and team leader was decided from amongst its membership to take the lead in developing a recommendation report. The Committee drafted a recommendation report on reducing health disparities by promoting patient-centered culturally and linguistically sensitive/competent health care that is pending appropriate review within the Department.

It brings together leading scientists, advocacy groups, patients with the illness and representatives from Federal agencies to discuss advances in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of CFS.  

The Committee is comprised of 11 members with expertise in biomedical research in the area of CFS, health care delivery services, insurers and voluntary organizations concerned with the problems of individuals with CFS.  Additionally, there are five, non-voting, ex-officio members who represent the NIH, CDC, FDA, SSA and HRSA at each of the meetings.  They provide critical information regarding their agencies’ activities related to CFS. CFSAC has established three sub-committees to assist in carrying out its mission.  The three subcommittees focus on topics of concern within the CFS community; the three subcommittees are: Research, Quality of Life/Patient Care, and Education.  These sub-committees hold bimonthly teleconferences to continue work on various issues and subsequently report back to the full Committee.

In lieu of a report, the Committee develops recommendations that are forwarded to the Assistant Secretary for Health and the Secretary for consideration.  The Committee’s recommendations are used to help guide basic, clinical, and population science research related to CFS, assist with development of public and provider awareness campaigns, assess and analyze the coding for reimbursement for treatment of patients with CFS illness and disseminate information regarding recent scientific findings.  The Committee held two meetings during FY 2008; an outcome of these meetings is the development of six recommendations by CFSAC during FY 2008.  The recommendations have been forwarded to the Secretary for consideration.  The recommendations can be viewed on the CFSAC website.  

It is anticipated that the CFSAC will continue to serve as a conduit for information from the Department to the patient population and vice versa.  CFSAC will continue to provide advice and make recommendations to the Department regarding efforts that can be undertaken to guide research and improve diagnosis, treatment and prevention of CFS, as well as to develop new and innovative ways to raise awareness of CFS among the patient and healthcare professional population.

The only annual reporting requirement that the CFSAC must satisfy is to update the file maintained in the FACA database for the annual comprehensive review.  There is no other requirement to provide an annual written report on the Committee’s activities/accomplishments.");

forest research portfolio:
1) Building Capacity
• Create a competitive interdisciplinary graduate and post-graduate training program that
develops cohorts of students trained to address complex forest issues. We recommend
an allocation of $3 million per year that could support ten institutional awards nationwide.
2) Research Initiatives
• Complete a large-scale genome sequencing project for the major U.S. commodity conifer,
Pinus taeda (Loblolly pine), over a period of five years.
• Develop a national forestry research program in the emerging technologies of nanotechnology
and biorefining. These technologies are critical to enhancing the global competitiveness
and energy security of the United States.
3) Efficiency and Effectiveness
• Develop a joint, annual review of Forest Service Research & Development and Cooperative
State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES) programs. The purpose of this
review would be to develop a coherent forest research portfolio that most efficiently addresses
America's forest research priorities.
• Competitive grants for forestry research are dispersed among several National Research
Initiative Competitive Grants Program (NRI) areas, resulting in a fragmented and
under-funded portfolio. Create a separate NRI panel that coordinates projects that relate to
forestry and forest ecosystems, including forest products (equivalent to $30 million).
The description of NRI programs should explicitly identify forest resources as it does for
agriculture, along with “sustaining the quality and productivity of the natural resources”
as now stated.
• Streamline USDA management of forest bioenergy and biobased products research by
designating one authoritative USDA program manager.
• Establish a joint task force drawing from Forest Service, CSREES, and partners to develop
new models for effective and timely delivery of research information to stakeholders
of forestry research.");

The recommendations are arranged by subject of the Committee's respective working group.  The date of the meeting that recommendations were made is noted in parenthesis.

PACA, Inspection Service and Market News:

Recommendation: The produce industry and the Market News Service should work together to educate industry members of the importance of providing accurate price and shipment information to the Market News Service. This educational effort should include information on the process, how information is gathered, how the information is used, and the potential ramifications of inaccurate reports. (April 2003)

Recommendation: The PACA and the Inspection Service should develop a long-range plan to review and re-evaluate the Grade Standards for perishable agricultural commodities. The process should involve members from all segments of the produce industry. The review and possible revision of U.S. standards is necessary to incorporate modern industry practices and terminologies. (April 2003)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends that software and computer systems used by USDA and various state agencies to administer the Federal-State Inspection Program are compatible to increase efficiencies and decrease costs. (April 2002)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recognizes the value of the destination market inspection service. (April 2002)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee would like to commend AMS Fruit and Vegetable Programs for their quick progress on developing and implementing a long-range plan to review and re-evaluate U.S. grade standards for perishable agricultural commodities. (February 2004)

Recommendation: USDA should seek to educate the industry as to what is meant by the USDA grade stamp.  USDA should discourage the representation of anything more than what it represents. (July 2004)

Recommendation: Mindful that an effective Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA) is critical to the fruit and vegetable industry, the Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends the following changes to the PACA:

•	Consolidate license functions to one location; reduce field offices to three locations;
•	Evaluate development of a national call center as an industry resource;
•	Evaluate increasing the filing fee for informal and formal complaints;
•	Increase industry outreach and web resources; and
•	Evaluate the inclusion of a processing fee for single-year license renewals. (July 2004)
 
Domestic Fruit and Vegetable Nutrition, Consumption and Distribution:

Recommendation: We recommend that USDA define the current distribution channels for fresh fruits and vegetables and develop, in complete detail, the optimum scenario for delivering fresh fruits and vegetables to schools with the highest quality, maximum efficiency and cost effectiveness.

	AMS/State warehouses
	Department of Defense
	Fresh Local Level Direct Purchasing (April 2003)

Recommendation: We ask USDA to break down each of these three distribution models in a way that all costs of the supply chain are identified. Once completed, we ask USDA to present this information to the Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee, thus allowing the Committee to review and provide recommendations in regards to improving models. (April 2003)

Recommendation: We recommend USDA communicate and celebrate an educational program which promotes successful local school food service programs encompassing fresh fruit and vegetable offerings like the Best Practices program and less reliance on competitive foods. The three areas that define success:

	Better nutrition
	Cost effectiveness, self sufficient food service programs
	More fruit and vegetable offerings overall (April 2003)

Recommendation: We encourage USDA to review current allocations of funds to effectively provide the ultimate objective of increasing of fresh fruits and vegetables in schools, and expanding the four-state pilot program. (April 2003)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee strongly recommends USDA promote the increased consumption of fruits and vegetables as a method to achieve good eating habits and to help facilitate the fight against obesity/malnutrition in the United States. (April 2002)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends that the appropriations of USDA be reallocated to more closely mirror the value of fruits and vegetables and their role in the health of the American consumer. (April 2002)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee encourages the formulation of a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Education that would initiate a curriculum including exercise and complete nutrition information about the benefits of eating fruits and vegetables. (April 2002)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee applauds USDA for finalizing the Memorandum of Understanding related to and becoming an active participant in the 5-A-Day For Better Health Campaign. (April 2002)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee advocates a closer working relationship with the appropriate state agencies that would facilitate the effective deliveries of USDA-purchased fresh fruits and vegetables through state warehouses to food recipients. This could include pilot projects. (April 2002)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee supports the reconciliation of U.S.-Canada differences related to the use of the 5-A-Day For Better Health Program logo. (April 2002)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee would like USDA to supplement the Food Stamp Program with an incentive mechanism that would allow eligible persons to buy additional fruits and vegetables. (April 2002)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee urges the study of more efficient distribution systems for USDA commodity purchase programs. (February 2004)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends that USDA continue existing programs and develop additional initiatives that will focus on increasing consumption of all fruits and vegetables in recognition of the tremendous health benefits that a daily diet, which includes five to ten servings of highly nutritious fruit and vegetables, provides.  USDA and other federal agencies should collaborate in programs that will increase fruit and vegetable consumption to help combat chronic diseases, including obesity. (February 2004)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee supports the continuation of programs promoting consumption of all fruits and vegetables.  We urge USDA to continue the Fresh Pilot Program. (February 2004)

Recommendation: USDA should develop a centralized means to communicate via a smooth delivery system scientifically sound nutritional information from the various sources used to develop the Dietary Guidelines.  The focus should be on the importance of education as the key to promoting increased consumption of fruits and vegetables to fight obesity and promote healthy living. (July 2004)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee strongly encourages the enhancement of the USDA purchase programs with incentives to include more fruits and vegetables. (July 2004)
 
Trade and Country of Origin:

Recommendation: USDA should be more specific in defining Country of Origin Labeling rules pertaining to the U.S. produce industry’s mandatory adherence to documentation requirements and violations; utilize familiar PACA rules to define Country of Origin Labeling requirements; and publish proposed final regulations in the Federal Register as soon as possible. (April 2003)

Recommendation: USDA should issue an opinion on the preservation of trust fund rights available under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA) of 1930 pertaining to electronic invoicing and a statement that USDA is in fact fulfilling buyers obligations in trust protection. (April 2003)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends that USDA, AMS continue its harmonization work with its counterparts in North America through the appropriate mechanism.  The immediate focus should be on implementing the following five harmonization initiatives which are essential elements of establishing a more positive business environment for produce trade across North America:

•	Development and implementation of a new destination market inspection service that builds on the USDA model in Canada;
•	Modernizing the licensing and arbitration regulations under the Canada Agriculture Products Act;
•	Development of an industry-lead strategy to reduce costly and disruptive practices in major markets in Canada;
•	Harmonization of Canadian and U.S. grade standards and inspection procedures; and
•	Development of a Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act-like trust in Canada. (January 2005)
 
Labor, Immigration and Crop Insurance:

Recommendation: The Secretary should send a letter to the White House endorsing the reform of H2A, the temporary foreign agricultural worker program, as proposed by Senator Craig and supported by the National Council of Agricultural Employers, and the earned adjustment status for the current agricultural workforce. (April 2003)

Recommendation: USDA is urged to fill the critically important position of special assistant for labor affairs with an expert in labor affairs. (April 2003)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee acknowledges the importance of agricultural labor in the production and distribution of agricultural commodities.  We would strongly support legislation that would provide a legal labor force for agricultural producers, including, but not limited to, immigration and H2A reform.  We also recognize the importance of the farmworker in our industry. (February 2004)
 
Food Safety, Third-Party Audits, Microbiological and Traceability:

Recommendation: USDA should either:

A. Increase funding of the Microbiological Data Program to generate information that will be useful in risk assessment to meet public health objectives; or
B. If the project can not be funded to meet the objectives, USDA should not appropriate additional funds beyond the 2003 fiscal year; or
C. Because data generated to date are inconclusive. USDA should not release findings until data from multiple years are accumulated and analyzed to draw conclusions. (April 2003)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee would like USDA to be a stronger advocate with other federal agencies in the development of science, outcome based regulations when proposed regulations are putting the U.S. fruit and vegetable industry at a competitive disadvantage. Examples: the Environmental Protection Agency; the Department of Labor; the Food and Drug Administration; the Immigration and Naturalization Service; and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. (April 2002)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee has concerns about USDA’s Microbiological Data Program (MDP) in its current form and questions:

	1) the objective of the MDP;
	2) how the information could be misunderstood/misused;
	3) the risk basis for choosing produce items; and
	4) the validity of the process of sampling and collecting. (April 2002)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends that future USDA research clearly address the impact on each segment of the supply and marketing chain, beginning with the grower. (April 2002)
 
Organic:

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends that USDA work to drive its organic program towards the education of consumers.  The relationship between the organic industry and the USDA should remain focused on using industry knowledge and USDA resources to build consumer confidence through strengthening the integrity of the National Organic Program.  The NOP needs to protect the integrity and values of the organic industry and its consumers by continuing its efforts to bring clarity to the federal rules. (January 2005)
 
Miscellaneous Topics:

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends that USDA continue to communicate support of the critical use exemption process concerning Methyl Bromide, which is written within the Montreal Protocol.  We recommend that concerns about economic impact to farms be kept at the highest level of priority when working within the decision and negotiation process.  We recommend to continue high involvement with the negotiating parties by providing real U.S. farm impacts.  We recommend voicing a concern to streamline this process to make this phase out a controlled and workable process, based on sound verifiable science. (February 2004)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee has established the following working groups and will provide feedback and recommendations for consideration by the next Committee meeting:

•	Food Defense and Security/Food Safety/Third Party Audits/Traceability
•	Organic
•	PACA and Potential Restructuring
•	Domestic Fruit and Vegetable Consumption and Distribution/Commodity Purchasing/Nutrition/Food Pyramid
•	Microbiological Data Program
•	Labor/Immigration/Crop Insurance (February 2004)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee would like the Secretary to recognize and if necessary mitigate the cost and impact that regulations have on the Fruit and Vegetable Industry.  Regulations may increase the cost of fruits and vegetables to consumers. (January 2005)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee strongly supports the full implementation of the Specialty Crop Competitiveness Act of 2004.  The Committee calls on the Secretary of Agriculture to include funding for the Specialty Crop Competitiveness Act in USDA’s budget request.  The Committee recognizes the importance of the Act as a significant tool to address the short and long-term industry competitiveness issues.  Funding this Act represents a critical step in advancing support and commitment for the U.S. fruit and vegetable industry. (January 2005)

Statement: Be it resolved that the Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee hereby recognizes A. J. Yates for his exemplary service as Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.  The Committee further acknowledges a lifetime of achievement, leadership, vision and contribution to advancing proactive initiatives to advance the profile of the fruit and vegetable industry.  The Committee expresses the sincere appreciation of the industry for a career of dedicated public service. (January 2005)

Statement: Be it resolved that the Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee hereby expresses appreciation to Secretary Ann Veneman for supporting the creation and continued existence of the Committee.  The Committee further applauds a career of stewardship and dedication to American agriculture. (January 2005)

After the second plenary meeting, three ad hoc working groups were established to develop information for the committee on future issues and concerns relating to three classes of biotechnology-derived products:   Group I-- crop (and transgenic terrestrial livestock animal) improvements; Group II-- quality improvements; and crop (and transgenic terrestrial livestock animal) specialty products.  The group members are:
Group I: Richard Crowder, Randal Giroux, Duane Grant, David Hoisington, Greg Jaffe, Keith Triebwasser, Lisa Zannoni.
Group II: Terry Medley, Margaret Mellon, Ronald Olson, Jerome Slocum.
Group III: Daryl Buss, Leon Corzine, Carole Cramer, Michael Dykes, Juan Enriquez-Cabot, Randal Giroux, David Magnus.

Following the December, 2003 plenary session, Work Groups were reorganized, with the following 3 new drafting groups:

Issues (that may arise over the next decade, for the 5-to-10 year perspective report):  Daryl Buss, Duane Grant, Michael Dykes, Greg Jaffe, Carole Cramer.

Scenarios for the future (for the 5-to-10 year perspective report):  Juan Enriquez, Jerry Slocum, Margaret Mellon, Terry Medley, Keith Triebwasser, Dave Hoisington.

A separate Traceability and Labeling Report:  Ron Olson, Randall Giroux, Greg Jaffe, Leon Corzine, Lisa Zannoni, Richard Crowder.


Work groups are open-ended, and any additional committee members may particiapte in work group discussions at their discretion.  Groups will meet in closed session via conference calls between plenary sessions, but all materials generated in those calls will be brought to plenary sessions for public discussion.

After her appointment to the AC21 in February, 2004, Carole Tucker Foreman joined the Issues Work Group.

Following the September, 2004, AC21 plenary session, the Issues Work Group was expanded to include all the members of the Traceability and Labeling Report group as well (that group continued to work on its other report also).

Two additional drafting Work Groups were also established at that time:

Definitions (for the 5-to-10 year perspective report):  Terry Medley, Carole Cramer, Randall Giroux

Introduction (for the 5-to-10 year perspective report):  Margaret Mellon, Richard Crowder, Michael Dykes, David Hoisington, Lisa Zannoni.

Please note that the AC21 decided at its February, 2005 meeting to turn the ""Scenarios"" chapter into a separate report (as part of the overall 5-to-10 year perspective charge to the committee) which was entitled, ""Preparing for the Future"" and which was submitted to the Secretary of Agriculture on May 9, 2005.

Following the August 9-10, 2005 plenary session, at which time members agreed to a significantly restructured format for the 5-to-10 year perspective report, existing work groups were viewed as no longer needed for completing the paper.  The committee was, however, divided into 3 (open-ended) groups who would meet via conference call for the purpose of drafting text on new topics discussed by the committee or reviewing Chair's draft text for the introductory portions (formal introduction plus the section on ""Realizing the Promise:  Opportunities and Challenges"") of the report.  The three groups were:  ""New Issues #1"": Michael Dykes, Robert Herdt, Ronald Olson, Margaret Mellon, Leon Corzine, Russell Kremer; ""New Topics #2"": Carol Tucker Foreman, Lisa Zannoni, Josephine Hunt, Duane Grant, Richard Crowder, Alison Van Eenennaam;  ""Introduction"":  Daryl Buss, Jerome Slocum, Gregory Jaffe, Bradley Shurdut, Randal Giroux, Carole Cramer,

At the same time, the Board serves as a guardian of institutional integrity, assisting the President to ensure the University continues to fulfill its stated mission.  To offer that level of support and challenge, if necessary, the Board must operate independently of the University, while maintaining open communication with both the President of the National Defense University and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

The Board continues to perform the role for which it was originally formed.  Since the establishment of the original Board in 1977, the University has grown considerably.  The Institute for National Strategic Studies (INSS) and the Information Resources Management College (IRMC) were established within NDU in 1984 and 1990 respectively.  In 1997 and 1998, the Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies (CHDS) and the Center for Defense Leadership and Management Program (CDLAMP) became part of NDU.  In 2002 CDLAMP became the School for National Security Executive Education (SNSEE) with Counterterrism Education as its core program. In 2004 the Institute for Homeland Security Studies was established with Homeland Security Education as its core program and the Center for Counterproliferation Research underwent a name change; its new name is ""the Center for Weapons of Mass Destruction; its core mission remains unchanged 

In 1998, under the terms of the Defense Reform Initiative (DRI), the Office of Net Assessment Corporate Fellows Program and the National Security Education Program (NSEP) joined the University.  In 2000, three additional elements were created and joined the University: the Near East-South Asia Center for Strategic Studies, the Africa Center for Strategic Studies, and the Center for Technology and National Security Policy.  The BOV serves all the new University components, as well as the original colleges.

Balanced membership is maintained on the Board.  Members represent a broad spectrum of expertise in government, business and education.  In addition, there is a balance between military and civilian national security practitioners, academicians and civilian leaders in public service and the private sector.

No existing staff or advisory committees can perform the Board's functions.  As in all highly regarded academic institutions, the observations, reviews and criticism of accomplished persons in various disciplines and professional backgrounds outside the faculty structure and government are needed to maintain a viable and forward looking educational program for senior students representing diverse professional backgrounds.

Accordingly, it is highly desirable to have an advisory board whose members have served at the highest levels of policy and decision-making in the Services, Federal Government, academia, and other realms, where they are recognized as top authorities in their field.
In February 1997, upon completion of an extended candidacy process, NDU received notification of accreditation by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.  Accreditation empowers the University to grant masters degrees to its senior college students upon their graduation.  One of the criteria established as a standard for accreditation (contained in the Commission on Higher Education's publication, Characteristics of Excellence in Higher Education) is that a university must have ""a governing board actively fulfilling its responsibilities of policy and resource development.""  In other words, since receiving re-accreditation in 2002, NDU's retention of a governing board, i.e., its Board of Visitors, was no longer discretionary.

The NGRAC, a statutory committee, was established in March 1992, under the USDA Departmental Regulation 1043-8 as directed by Section 1632 of P.L. 101-624 of the 1990 Farm Bill. Its charter was last renewed in March 1999 and expired in March 2001.  The NGRAC is appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture, and its duties are solely advisory to the Secretary and the Director of the National Genetic Resources Program (NGRP) on matters concerning the NGRP, established by the U.S. Congress to: acquire, characterize, preserve, document, and distribute to scientists germplasm of all life forms important for food and agricultural production. The NGRAC responds to the important issues of the nation in respect to conserving and utilizing genetic resources for food and agriculture. It meets twice a year, and can consist of up to nine members appointed by the Secretary and seven or more ex-officio members. Two-thirds of the appointed members represent the scientific disciplines relevant to NGRP, and one-third represent the general public in relevant activities. Thus, it is likely that each of the life forms in NGRP (plants, forest species, animals, aquatics, insects, and microbes) is represented by only one appointed scientific member.  The most recent meeting of the NGRAC was in August 1999 in Washington, D.C.Five new members were newly appointed in September 2000. The NGRAC’s most recent recommendations to the Department and the Program are included on its web page at http://www.ars-grin.gov/ngrac/

Currently, the NGRAC is inactive, pending rechartering.  New members must be appointed, or current members reappointed.  It would meet at least once, and perhaps twice, in 2004, likely in the mid-late spring, and early autumn. The agenda for such meeting would, of course, be strongly determined by the chair and members, but the following issue would likely merit high priority for discussion: 1) international genetic resource treaties and agreements, e.g., the International Treaty for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture; 2) review of USDA’s progress with acting on the previous NGRAC recommendation to the USDA and the NGRP to develop a road map (more explicit in relevant content than the broad Agricultural Research Service Six-Year Plan) and strategic plan for its genetic resources and genomics programs; 3) review of activities of other Advisory Committees, in particular those that deal with genetic resources, such as the ones on Agricultural Biotechnology and Invasive Species; 4) review of current budgets and fiscal status of USDA genetic resource programs; 5) review recent domestic and international developments associated with the application of intellectual property rights protection to plant genetic resources.");

The National Water Quality Monitoring Council of ACWI provided an interim report to ACWI representatives on the Design of a National Water Quality Monitoring Network for U.S. Coast and Upland Watersheds. ACWI concurred with moving forward toward a final report due to the Council on Environmental Quality in January 2006. ACWI member organizations encouraged the Council to work on a plan to include Ground Water in the National Network; and to include metrics in the Network Design. The Monitoring Council also worked with ACWI member organizations to plan and organize a 5th National Monitoring Conference to be held in San Jose, California in May 2006. Over 300 abstracts and posters have been received.

The Methods and Data Comparability Board of ACWI completed the addition of biological elements to the Water Quality Data Elements. A guide for use of the Data Elements was prepared for publication in early 2006. Areas to be considered for future data element standardization include physical habitat assessments and studies for fish tissue burdens. ACWI recommended that the Data Elements be aligned with the Federal Geographic Data Committee Standards. 

The Methods Board added 100 new methods to the National Environmental Methods Index on-line database, and completed improvements that will enhance public use and access. The Methods Board also developed a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement to allow the private sector to partner in further development of NEMI. 

The Sustainable Water Resources Roundtable of ACWI prepared a preliminary report on Water Resources Sustainability Indicators, including 17 recommended indicators. ACWI supported publication of the report, and encouraged the Roundtable to work with state and regional water quality monitoring councils on indicator issues.

The 2004 ACWI Task Force on the USGS Cooperative Water Program prepared a draft final report for ACWI review. ACWI requested addition of an Executive Summary, suggested expanded sections on in-kind services and funding issues, and requested a focus on how to improve of the Program.

The Subcommittee on Hydrology and the Subcommittee on Sedimentation of ACWI worked together to plan and organize a Joint Interagency Conference on Sedimentation and Hydrologic Modeling with a theme of Interdisciplinary Solutions for Watershed Sustainability, to be held in April 2006 in Nevada. The joint conference will provide Federal and non-Federal scientists and managers from many disciplines the opportunity to discuss recent accomplishments and progress in research and technical developments. Combining the 8th Sedimentation and 3rd Modeling conferences saves all participating Federal agencies and other participants significant resources in both staff time and funding.

The Subcommittee on Spatial Water Data, reporting jointly to ACWI and the Federal Geographic Data Committee, created an interagency Steering Committee for the Watershed Boundary Dataset, to facilitate the development and availability of data via standards, advanced technology, quality control, and data access. The Committee will promote the adoption of standards by all partners and leverage available resources. The WBD comes under authority from OMB Circular A-16, revised 2002.

The National Liaison Committee to the USGS National Water Quality Assessment Program worked with the Water Environment Federation (an ACWI member) and the Environmental Energy and Study Institute to conduct a series of briefings on Capital Hill in February 25 and March, 2005. Topics included Water Quality Monitoring:  Answers It Provides for Water Quality Protection; Moving from Monitoring to Prediction: The Quality of the Nation’s Streams, and The Quality of the Nation’s Ground Water. The briefings were attended by a total of 145 individuals. The briefings were successful in demonstrating how modeling can be used to expand the information gained through monitoring and how the resulting information can then be used in water protection policy and activities. A checklist was created for developing such briefings for policy audiences. 

Assistance was provided to Liaison Committee participants in distributing NAWQA information about the water quality and general environmental conditions in NAWQA study units and indications of study unit areas at particular risk of environmental decline due to rapid population growth or other factors. A list of contacts in specific study units can support the utility of NAWQA information in making local and statewide water quality protection decisions.

PCPFS made approximately four major recommendations during FY 2005: 1. Recommended that the on-line interactive website for The President’s Challenge program be continuously evaluated and improved to increase physical activity among all Americans aged 6 and older. This recommendation was made to support and advance the physical activity pillar of the President’s Healthier US initiative. 2. Recommended that more public/private partnerships be formed to leverage the visibility of the PCPFS and the partnering organizations to promote the importance of physical activity, fitness and sports participation. 3. Recommended that a science partnership be formed. 4. Recommended that an event be launched to celebrate National Physical Fitness and Sports Month (“May Month”) 2005.

• Over 4 million Americans earned a presidential recognition award in FY 2005. • Over 30 thousand schools participated in the President’s Challenge program, and 42 demonstration centers were selected. • Since the launch of the interactive program Web site in July 2003, (www.presidentschallenge.org), over 500,000 unique visitors have been on the site, and over 250,000 individuals have signed up for the President’s Challenge online to track their physical activities. • In summer 2004, a contract was awarded to implement the HealthierFeds Physical Activity Challenge, which utilizes the President’s Challenge program to encourage and build a healthy federal workforce. Over thirty thousand federal employees in thirty federal agencies signed up to participate in the program, which concluded in December, 2004. • Held winter sports clinic (2004  in Wintergreen, Virginia and 2005 in Libertyville, PA) for Winter Trails Day, with SnowSports Industries America’s “Winter Feels Good” campaign. • Held the HealthierUS Fitness Festival (May, 2005) on the National Mall, in conjunction with the Congressional Fitness Caucus and eighty health and fitness organizations. Over 2000 people attended. • PCPFS members and the Executive Director gave over 100 regional and national speeches and presentations. • Following recommendations made at Council meetings, contacts were initiated with state and territorial governors through the HHS Regional Directors, generating increased interest in PCPFS programs and information resources. The Wisconsin Governor’s Challenge was launched in Spring ’04 and has been used as a template for other states. • PCPFS’s executive director and Council members gave over 100 media interviews, including interviews and web chats for the Washington Post and USA Today. • PCPFS produced four Research Digests, which translate the latest research on a high interest topic in the area of physical activity and sports medicine for health/fitness professionals and other interested citizens. • PCPFS continued distribution of “Kids in Action: Physical Activity from Birth to Age Five,” developed by the PCPFS in partnership with the Kelloggs’ Company to promote physical activity for infants, toddlers and pre-school children. • PCPFS continued distribution Rx -- Physical Activity: Take the President’s Challenge, with the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE). • Over sixty five partnerships were formed with corporations and organizations who are implementing the President’s Challenge program at the grassroots and/or national level. • Partnerships include: 1) “I Can Do It, You Can Do It ”, an initiative with the HHS Office on Disability, which uses the President’s Challenge Physical Activity and Fitness Awards program and pairs mentors with disabled children to encourage and increase their physical activity. Mentors provide guidance and instruction to youth with disabilities as they become and stay physically active. A pilot program with participation of ten major disabled organizations was implemented; 2) the “You Can” campaign of the Administration on Aging (AOA) has over 1,000 partners and utilizes the President’s Challenge as the physical activity tracking tool .The PCPFS Science Board continued its work after initially being formed in ‘03 to review publications, offer feedback re: newly forming sports/physical activity clinics, and to serve as science experts for PCPFS publications and programs, including the President’s Challenge. Ten renowned exercise scientists were selected to serve on this Board. • A science partnership was formed with American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM). • PCPFS promoted outdoor recreation on public lands in conjunction with a Federal Interagency Work Group (the Recreation MOU: HHS, Departments of the Interior; USDA Forest Service; USA Corps of Engineers). • To help reduce racial and ethnic health disparities, the PCPFS translated the following brochures into Spanish: President’s Challenge overview, “Kids in Action,” Rx-Physical Activity: Take the President’s Challenge.

All recommendations have been fully implemented with success. 1) President’s Challenge Web site continues to grow in participants, and advanced functions have been added. 2) Over 60 partnerships were formed with corporations and organizations that are implementing the President’s Challenge program and raising the awareness of physical activity benefits nationally. 3) A science partnership with American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) was formed. 4) The HealthierUS Fitness Festival brought together on the National Mall 80 organizations and more than 2000 participants and featured Secretary Leavitt. Event increased the visibility of PCPFS members and Executive Director as well as the awareness of programs & resources by utilizing the media and creating new speaking opportunities to further spread the message on the importance of physical activity to health and well-being.


In addition to the noted activities, the PCPFS developed and published a fact sheet on ""Who We Are, What We Do.""  The Council has published two e-newsletters and numerous features that also can be viewed on the PCPFS website, www.fitness.gov.

RECOMMENDATION:  “When termination of a volunteer is warranted, VHA Handbook 1620.1.4.b (pg. 4) states: ‘Written notification of termination will be sent to the volunteer, and if affiliated, the VAVS Representative.’  It is recommended that, if the volunteer to be terminated is the VAVS Representative, written notification of termination must also be sent to the National Representative and/or the National Certifying Official of the affiliated organization.”

	VA COMMENT:  Approved.  Communication is key to a successful volunteer program.  Providing notification to national veterans service organization officials of actions by the Voluntary Service Program Manager keeps communication flowing and encourages the full participation of each organization.
 
	b.  RECOMMENDATION:  “To attract youth organizations and business entities to the VAVS program, it is recommended that VA create a recognition/awards program acknowledging the meaningful contributions of those organizations or groups that, while not eligible for NAC membership, have had a positive impact on the VAVS program.”

	VA COMMENT:  Approved.  Recognizing the valuable contributions of any volunteer or organization is paramount.  NAC will develop a mechanism to recognize and reward these organizations nationally.  

	c.  RECOMMENDATION:  “To ensure the continuation of the VAVS program in perpetuity, and to sustain and expand the VAVS contributions to the fulfillment of VA’s mission, VA has set a priority to target the recruitment of VAVS volunteers in the 20-40 year age group.  To capitalize on the computer skills of this target group, it is recommended that a discussion page be added to the VAVS website, so that volunteers can share their experiences, generate ideas, and recruit new volunteers.” 
 
	VA COMMENT:  Approved.  The growing number of individuals utilizing the World Wide Web is evident of the need to further expand the VAVS presence there.  Providing an opportunity for active volunteers to post their experiences in a “guest book” format could provide motivation to others to volunteer.

	d.  RECOMMENDATION: “To sustain the momentum of new volunteers and to increase retention, it is recommended that VA urge each facility utilizing VAVS volunteers to issue a thank you letter from the facility director upon completion of the first three (3) months of volunteer activity.”

	VA COMMENT:  Disapproved.  Many stations already acknowledge new volunteers in some fashion and it is not necessary to mandate such an action.  Volunteerism is changing and the motivation for continued service is very diverse.  Allowing stations to customize recognition activities is crucial.

	e.  RECOMMENDATION: “Make a Difference Day is a unique program that inspires and rewards volunteers, and began with a simple idea: Put your own cares on hold for one (1) day to care for someone else.  Sponsored by USA WEEKEND Magazine and its more than 600 carrier newspapers, and in partnership with the Points of Light Foundation, Make a Difference Day is the largest and most encompassing national day of helping others.  This one-day event is held annually on the fourth Saturday in October (if participation on Saturday is not possible for religious reasons, projects may be done on Sunday).  It is therefore recommended that VA encourage local facilities to coordinate annual programs or events (e.g. homeless fairs, stand downs, etc.), in partnership with community organizations, on Make a Difference Day.  VA’s participation in this national event promoting community involvement would raise VA’s visibility, enhance VA’s mission, strengthen VA’s community ties, and promote recruitment of VAVS volunteers.”

	VA COMMENT: Approved.  Each facility will be encouraged to participate in “Make a Difference Day,” as they are able or to partner with other community organizations.

Title II of that law established the Dayton Aviation Heritage Commission.  The Commission was established to assist Federal, State, and local authorities and the private sector in preserving and managing the historic resources in the Miami Valley, Ohio, associated with the Wright brothers, aviation, or Paul Laurence Dunbar.  The powers given the Dayton Commission extend beyond those usually associated with an advisory commission and place it in the category of an operating commission.  Public Law 102-419 also limited the range of individuals who could be appointed to serve as members.  The limitation was cited in a statement by the President at the time the legislation was signed.  The statement concluded that, because of the limitation, the Commission could perform only advisory functions and not exercise Government power.  Consequently, the commission was initially chartered to carry out only the advisory responsibilities of the law, thereby making the committee subject to the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.  Subsequently, on November 12, 1996, Public Law 104-333 (Division I, section 811) amended the procedures for appointing members to the Commission.  Accordingly, the Commission was rechartered, authorizing the undertaking of the full complement of responsibilities authorized by Public Law 102-419.  As an operational committee, the Dayton Aviation Heritage Commission, is not subject to the Federal  Advisory Committee Act, and should be removed from the reporting process.");

And, as mentioned previously, specialists from OSAC's Research and Information Support Center (RISC) provide security consultations to about 350 representatives from the U.S. private sector monthly.

Section V.d. of the Council's Charter requires that the Council report to the Department of State's Under Secretary for Management through the Council's Executive Secretary and specifies that the reporting method may be ""oral and/or written"".  The Council complies with this requirement through briefings on Council activities, issues, and recommendations, which the Executive Secretary provides on at least a monthly basis to the Department's Assistant Secretary for Administration.  The Assistant Secretary in turn reports the substance of these briefings to the Under Secretary for Management.  In addition, the Executive Secretary provides brief written summaries on each Council Annual and Executive Committee Meeting and other significant activities for inclusion in the Bureau of Administration's  Weekly Activity Report,which the Bureau provides to the Under Secretary for Management.  For example, the Executive Secretary submitted written reports on the participation of three American overseas schools in the Johnson & Johnson-sponsored summer training institute on drug & alcohol abuse prevention at Rutgers University in July 2006 and OSAC's update of the Emergency Procedures Manual for American overseas schools that includes information on preparing for pandemics such as Avian flu.  The Council had  distributed the manual to American overseas schools and to U.S. diplomatic posts in 2003, posted it on the Department’s Intranet at http://aopros.a.state.gov, and is considering updating and reissuing it in 2006. 

In January 2006, the Executive Secretary, the Council Chair and several other members, and the Acting Assistant Secretary for Administration met with the Under Secretary for Management to discuss ways that the Council could work more closely with the Department to maintain the high quality of American overseas schools.  The Under Secretary committed her office to supporting the Council's work fully and indicated that she would sponsor a meeting with U.S.corporate leaders to obtain their support for the Council's program.  Also as a result of this meeting, the Assistant Secretary for Administration wrote letters to 100 CEOs of U.S. corporations requesting their support for the Council's 2006 Educational Assistance Program to assist American overseas schools.  Finally, the Assistant Secretary is considering using the Council to help the Department develop five public-private parnerships with the U.S. corporate community that will significantly enhance the quality of education in American overseas schools.  These partnerships include establishing a capital development revolving loan fund that would provide loans to American overseas schools for major facilities improvements, a world virtual school that would enable these schools to continue instruction during emergencies, grants to enable additional American overseas schools to establish programs for students with special needs.  The public-private partnership initiative also includes expanding the Council's Project AERO (American Education Reaches Out) to update the information tools and support that American overseas schools need to establish and maintain an American, standards-based curriculum.  

Item 18 Costs.  The differences between the cost estimates in this annual report and the cost estimate in the annual report for 2005 reflects the Federal cost of living and locality adjustments provided to FTE and similar cost of living adjustments provided to contractor personnel, which support the Council.

While the Council has no subcommittees per se, it does have an Evaluation Committee, composed of four members that the Council Chair appoints.  The membership of the Evaluation Committee includes the Council Chair, at least one of the Vice Chairs, and two other Council members.  The Evaluation Committee reviews educational improvement/enhancement proposals for American overseas schools, which the Overseas Schools Regional Associations submit for Council sponsorship.  After completing these reviews, the Evaluation Committee makes recommendations on the proposals to the full Council for consideration.  The full Council then accepts, rejects, modifies, or defers  the Evaluation Committee's recommendations.  In addition the Council has established two ad hoc committees -  one on communications and one on fundraising.  The Communications Committee has implemented a website through Council member, AOL, to improve communications among members about Council activities and business.  The Fundraising Committee has considered a variety of ways to improve the Council's fundraising efforts that support its annual Educational Assistance Program.  One of these will be a direct appeal to the top 20 corporate users of American overseas schools to obtain significant amounts of money for the Council's program ($25,000 or more per company.");

The Lake Clark National Park SRC met on February 16, 2006 in Port Alworth, AK took the following actions on Federal Subsistence wildlife proposals:
The Lake Clark National Park Subsistence Resource Commission (SRC) met on February 16, 2006 and considered the following wildlife proposals to make regulatory changes to the federal subsistence program. With regard to proposals 01, 02 and 23, the Lake Clark SRC makes the following recommendations: 

PROPOSAL 1: To prevent commercialization in the sale of handicrafts made from bear parts. 

Support. The SRC supports measures that allow qualified subsistence users to maximize the benefits derived from legally harvested bears taken in the subsistence hunt.

PROPOSAL 2: To allow qualified subsistence users to sell handicraft articles made from non edible byproducts of wildlife harvested for subsistence purposes.

Support. The SRC supports measures that allow subsistence users to maximize the benefits derived from legally harvested wildlife taken in subsistence hunts.

PROPOSAL 23: To create a new subsistence permit hunt for Dall sheep in Unit 9(B).

Support with modification. The SRC supports the creation of a new Federal registration permit hunt for Dall sheep inside Lake Clark National Park and Preserve with the following amendments. 

First, there is a typographic error in the section describing the proposed regulation. The version in the proposal book states, “1 ram with 7/8  3/4  curl or larger horns.” The proposed regulation should delete the reference to 7/8 and read, “1 ram with ¾ curl or larger horns.”  






We also recommend that the permit condition concerning taking sheep above 1000 feet be amended as follows:

“No sheep may be taken above the 1000 foot elevation line designated on the map accompanying the permit.”

The SRC discussed at length how hunters could easily identify the 1000 foot elevation line to avoid confusion and inadvertent violation of the permit condition. After consultation with park staff, it was decided that the NPS will produce a topographic map with a clearly delineated 1000 foot elevation line and give a copy to each hunter requesting a permit.

We further recommend that the proposal be amended to include the following language to allow the park Superintendent to close the sheep hunt if the harvest limit is taken before the end of the published hunting season:

“If the allowable harvest levels are reached before the regular closing date, the Superintendent of Lake Clark National Park and Preserve will announce an early closure.”

This language will help prevent over harvesting of Dall sheep by delegating the authority to close the hunt to a local official who is actively monitoring hunting activity and success.


The Lake Clark National Park Subsistence Resource Commission appreciates the opportunity to share with you its recommendations on these federal subsistence proposals.

These procedures go far to ensuring the full implementation of the statutory mandate to publish a Foreign Relations series that is ""complete and accurate."" The Committee advised on a major reform and modernization of the preparation of volumes in the series, including publication of documentation on the Internet.  Th Committee closely monitored the design and implementation of the reform process. The Committee also provided continuous advice and support to Department and government-wide efforts to reform the management of 25-year old and older national security records and to implement E.O. 12958 on this subject.

The Board was given additional responsibilities to evaluate and review protocols of REE programs under the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act (AREERA) of 1998.  This new legislation broadens the Board's obligations concerned with stakeholder input, priority setting, and accountability issues.  The Board reflects the interests of stakeholders nationwide and provides advice vital to the current and future success of food, forestry, and agricultural programs.  The Board has already made significant contributions with recommendations on the following: Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) and the Research, Education, and Economics (REE) Strategic and Performance Plans; REE priority setting and policies; merit and peer review procedures; relevancy and adequacy of funding of REE programs; and public communication. The Advisory Board continually solicited stakeholder input and made changes to their recommendations on priorities and funding accordingly, and gave advise on changes to the REE Strategic Planning Task Force Report on agricultural research facilities. The Board has recommended the advancement of direct and long-term research funding and supported legislation to further address critical research areas. The breadth of agricultural research issues and the Board's broadened activites under the 1998 AREERA legislation, require efficient and thorough review and analyses, which are most effectively done with working groups/ad hoc committees in a teamwork approach that utilitizes a continuous mechanism of input, review, recommendations and feedback.  With the increased number of meetings required to address Board requirements, conference calls have been successful and cost effective. Focus sessions during full Board meetings highlight the scientific basis of agricultural research and explore new avenues of research and education for the public good.  Reports and publications serve as important resources for USDA, congressional, and public information.  They provide annual updates; reflect broad stakeholder views; and highlight critical food, forestry, and agricultural research, education, and extension activities.  Readers can understand emerging issues, agricultural research needs, and recognize the many public benefits resulting from Federal investments. The Board requires two general Advisory Board meetings, one national stakeholder symposium, and at least one regional ""listening session"" yearly in order to fulfill its mandate. The Board plans to conduct its second review of the relevance and adequacy of funding of the REE portfolio for FY 2002; review the Request For Proposal (RFP) and the portfolio of projects under new appropriations for integrated funding of agricultural research; finalize recommendations on Small Farms Research for the REE Under Secretary; and explore the needs and issues of agricultural biotechnology via a focus session on this subject. Some of the suggested themes for FY 2000 focus sessions include: 1) Higher Education Partnerships for 1862, 1890, and 1994 Land Grant Institutions: Perspectives on their development, support, and linkages under current mandates and 2) Changing of pricing and marketing structures in the food and fiber system. Recommendations by the Advisory Board to the Secretary have been useful to USDA in its ongoing policy and priority setting deliberations. The Board should remain fully funded to ensure that stakeholders are represented in the priority-setting national and regional process and that the Board's responsibilities are addressed effectively and efficiently to help USDA maintain a state-of-the-art research portfolio which is critical for continued world leadership of U.S. agriculture.");

GSA and ONDCP agreed that no personnel payments should be identified.  Item 19 of the same form requires that agencies estimate the amount of Federal staff support years associated with the reporting year and the projected amounts for the next fiscal year.  Although line 19 is described on the form as corresponding to the amount of such personnel payments in line 18, GSA advised ONDCP to identify an FTE equivalent associated with actual (and projected) time ONDCP employees engage in Committee-related activities.  The numbers indicated are consistent with this agreement.  The increase for the next reporting period are based on projected increase in Committee activity potentially out of the OMB clearance of the final report, the hours associated with clearing the two additional nominees, as well as the likelihood that additional nominations will be made.

Update (11/9/07): Although there hasn’t been a meeting convened for sometime,   the ASAC is considered a valuable forum for the Administrator to seek views and input from our stakeholders relating to Aviation.   Its continuation is vital to our objective for improving aviation security measures.   For the past year, we have continued to utilize other forums, such as the Sector Coordination Council, as a channel to gain input from our stakeholders.  In the future we will continue to utilize both forums as mechanisms to leverage our stakeholder’s views; gain input; and address concerns.   

The ASAC charter expires on 11/28, and is currently going through the renewal process.  Pending approval of charter renewal, a meeting will be scheduled NLT March 2008.

INSERT INTO Recommendations97_08 (ID, CID, CNo, FY, Recommendation, LegislationRequired, LegislationStatus, Remarks) VALUES (10400,31577,5136,"2007","Continue","No ","Enacted","The Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Advisory Committee (CFSAC) is a Federal Advisory Committee within the Department of Health and Human Services that serves to provide science-based advice and recommendations to the Secretary on a broad range of issues and topics pertaining to chronic fatigue and related syndromes (CFS).  It brings together leading scientists, advocacy groups, patients with the illness and representatives from Federal agencies to discuss advances in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of CFS.  

The Committee is comprised of 11 members with expertise in biomedical research in the area of CFS, health care delivery services, insurers and voluntary organizations concerned with the problems of individuals with CFS.  Additionally, there are five, non-voting, ex-officio members who represent the NIH, CDC, FDA, SSA and HRSA at each of the meetings.  They provide critical information regarding their agencies’ activities related to CFS.  In the last year, three sub-committees – Research, Quality of Life/Patient Care, and Education - have also been formed.  These sub-committees hold bimonthly teleconferences to continue work on various issues and subsequently report back to the full Committee.

In lieu of a report, the Committee develops recommendations that are forwarded to the Assistant Secretary for Health and the Secretary for consideration.  The Committee’s recommendations are used to help guide basic, clinical, and population science research related to CFS, assist with development of public and provider awareness campaigns, assess and analyze the coding for reimbursement for treatment of patients with CFS illness and disseminate information regarding recent scientific findings.  The Committee held two meetings during FY 2007; an outcome of these meetings is the development of six recommendations by CFSAC during FY 2007.  The recommendations can be viewed on the CFSAC website.  

At the November 2006 meeting, the NIH announced up to $4 million in funding for seven new studies of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) in response to a special RFA issued earlier. The proposed studies will help researchers understand how the diverse symptoms in CFS are related to the interactions between the immune and neurological systems—an important step towards developing effective treatments for a disabling condition.

At the May 2007 meeting, CDC reported that the CFS Public Awareness Campaign, that had been launched in November 2006, has generated tremendous awareness – including reaching hundreds of millions of viewer impressions via TV and radio public service announcements, and via print and online ads.  More than 1,500 stories on CFS and the campaign have been conducted since the launch event. In addition, the “Faces of CFS” traveling exhibit has commenced on a national tour of high-impact venues, which include national conferences of health care professionals.

The Secretary of Health and Human Services, Michael Leavitt, uses a 500-Day Plan as a management tool to guide his energies in fulfilling the President's vision of a healthier and more hopeful America.  The Plan includes actions that the Department can complete within 500 days that will yield results within 5,000 days.  The Secretary's 5,000 days vision seeks to advance medical research through encouraging the formation of interdisciplinary teams to “attack” diseases from multiple approaches.  The research alluded to above is a prime example of just such an interdisciplinary approach to investigating the causes of CFS.  Molecular geneticists, physicists, mathematicians, sociologists and chemists worked to elucidate the genetic factors that might contribute to causing CFS illness.  Each group arrived at the same general conclusions from radically different approaches.  The CFSAC strongly endorses this interdisciplinary approach to problem solving, and the NIH and CDC have funded interdisciplinary projects as a result. 

It is anticipated that the CFSAC will continue to serve as a conduit for information from the Department to the patient population and vice versa.  This communication will continue to guide research and improve diagnosis, treatment and prevention of CFS.  The expected annual accomplishments also include developing new and innovative ways to raise awareness of CFS amongst the patient and healthcare professional population as well as renewing a focus on issues surrounding insurance coverage of CFS treatments as well as assessments of disability claims for CFS.

In accordance with its charter, it has also addressed a ninth topic, the ethics of stem cell research, which is the one area that the Council is mandated to ""monitor"" on an ongoing basis.  

The Council may initiate an inquiry, gather information and data through expert presentations, seek to clarify the ethical questions (especially those of relevance to the need for public education and for policy formation by the President and/or U.S. Congress), and yet conclude that these questions are such that the Council has no unique contribution to make to debate ""in the public square.""  Or, it may decide that it does have a unique contribution to make and thus should devote the requisite staff resources (and Council effort) to an inquiry that will issue in a report to the President and the public.  With any one of these potential results, the process is neither ""quick"" nor superficial.

Of the topics we have pursued thus far, the Council ultimately decided not to move forward to the issuance of a report on the ethics of clinical research and children and bioethics.  The members did decide, however to issue reports on three topics thus far and are now in the decision making process with respect to two additional topics.  The process of moving forward with an inquiry that will issue in a report usually entails additional research, staff drafting of the text, and then the distribution of the draft text to selected experts in the field, prior to finalizing the text.  This process has been implemented in an effort to ensure that the ultimate product of our work is empirically correct, conceptually sound, and of the best quality possible to present to the President, and consequently for dissemination to members of the U.S. Congress and the general public.

Publication of the following documents is impending:

(1) a report on the the bioethical significance of human dignity:  this report has been typeset and will be printed by GPO within the next month;

(2) a ""white paper"" on controversies in the determination of death:  this report has been drafted, reviewed by outside experts, and will now go into production with the aim of printing it before the close of calendar year; and

(3) a comprehensive report on organ procurement, allocation, and transplantation:  this report has been drafted and is now under review.  The target date for printing is late January 2008.

The Council is scheduled to meet in November.  Topics to be discussed by the Council at that meeting include whether to issue reports on the ""crisis"" of the healing professions and on the moral basis of health care.

With the topic of the ethics of nanotechnology, the Council decided not to issue a full report.  However, the Council will publish a summary of its deliberations on this topic in response to a request from another Presidential advisory committee.  The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology has requested that the Bioethics Council provide information that will assist it with its own ongoing work in this area.  The summary will be published on the Council's website in mid-December.

Finally, with respect to stem cell research, the Council held a session on this topic in November 2006 and will likely hold another in early 2008.  Meanwhile, the Council Chairman, Dr. Edmund Pellegrino, has continued to consult with the President on recent legislative activity in this topic area, thus fulfilling the first and foremost mission of the Council, to advise the President on advances in biotechnology, biomedicine and biomedical research.

The Board provides its advice and recommendation during meetings and in its meeting minutes and letters to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

From its founding, the Board has provided expert guidance on a range of vital academic issues and greatly contributed to the University’s education, outreach and research functions. At the same time, the Board serves as a guardian of institutional integrity, assisting the President to ensure the University continues to fulfill its stated mission. To offer that level of support and challenge, if necessary, the Board must operate independently of the University, while maintaining open communication with both the President of the National Defense University and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Board continues to perform the role for which it was originally formed. Since the establishment of the original Board in 1977, the University has grown considerably. The Institute for National Strategic Studies (INSS) and the Information Resources Management College (IRMC) were established within NDU in 1984 and 1990 respectively. In 1997 and 1998, the Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies (CHDS) and the Center for Defense Leadership and Management Program (CDLAMP) became part of NDU. In 2002, CDLAMP became the School for National Security Executive Education (SNSEE) with counter-terrorism education as its core program. In 2004, the Center for Counter-proliferation Research  underwent a name change to the Center for Study of Weapons of Mass Destruction; in and in 2008, its core mission expanded to include Joint Professional Military Education.

Update (11/9/07): Although there hasn’t been a meeting convened for sometime,   the ASAC is considered a valuable forum for the Administrator to seek views and input from our stakeholders relating to Aviation.   Its continuation is vital to our objective for improving aviation security measures.   For the past year, we have continued to utilize other forums, such as the Sector Coordination Council, as a channel to gain input from our stakeholders.  In the future we will continue to utilize both forums as mechanisms to leverage our stakeholder’s views; gain input; and address concerns.

All but 2 of the 27 active ACWI member organizations were represented, and 7 work groups reported on their activities. The ACWI Accomplishments from the 2007 meeting include: ACWI unanimously approved a motion to accept the request from the Chair of the Committee on Ocean Policy from the Council on Environmental Quality for the ACWI, through the Council to continue their involvement in the ""National Water Quality Monitoring Network for U.S. Coastal Waters and their Tributaries"" (Network). An interagency Working Group (IAG) for the Network, as recommended by ACWI in 2006, was formed, with representatives from the USGS, USEPA, NOAA and the President's Office of Science and Technology Policy, to carry out Phase Two Pilot Studies, under the guidance of the Council's Network Steering Committee. The three Network pilot studies, selected from 12 expressions of interest, cover three geographic areas including Delaware Bay, Lake Michigan, and San Francisco Bay. During 2007, the Network (IAG), has held weekly conference calls to guide and monitor the progress of the pilots, which have surveyed current monitoring and are identifying gaps and costs in relation to the specifications in the National Network design. The results from the pilot Studies will be reported to ACWI at the January 2008 Annual Meeting. 

The National Monitoring Council Presented a plan to reorganize the Council's work groups, consolidating 4 into 3 and creating several sub-groups. The National Monitoring Council also reported to ACWI on plans for the 6th National Monitoring Conference to be held on the East Coast in May 2008. Since the January meeting, Atlantic City, New Jersey was selected as the site of the Conference, and over 300 abstracts have been received. The Tri-Chairs represent ACWI member agencies USGS, USEPA and NOAA. ACWI member the Water Environment Federation will assist with conference management. 

ACWI members unanimously approved the formation of a new ACWI Subcommittee on Ground Water (SOGW) to be co-chaired by the USGS Office of Ground Water and the ACWI representative from the American Society of Civil Engineers. The Terms of Reference was approved. The National Ground Water Association, an ACWI member organization, will provide Executive Secretarial support to the new subcommittee. ACWI provided input on the proposed working groups at a roundtable session. The SOGW held its first formal two-day meeting at the U.S. Geological Survey in May 2007. It has 11 member organizations with 3 alternates, and has formed 4 working groups on Data Management Standards, Monitoring Inventory, Field Practices, and Monitoring Design. A draft plan for a National Ground Water Monitoring network will be presented at the ACWI 2008 annual meeting in February. More details on the web site at http://acwi.gov/sogw/index.html

The National Apprenticeship System continues to benefit from the committee’s invaluable expertise as it provides objective and useful recommendations that are balanced and industry driven.  This level of advice is necessary and essential as the system seeks to develop skilled talent that will prove competitive in a 21st century economy. 

A significant number of the committees recommendations have been supported by the Department, and have resulted in several high impact initiatives which include but are not limited to the Advancing Apprenticeship Initiative (AAI), education and outreach strategies, sales oriented/customer focused training approaches for both the Office of Apprenticeship and State Apprenticeship Council (SAC) staff, suggested revisions to Apprenticeship regulations, and a year-long commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the National Apprenticeship Act.

Additionally, the Board has increased its direct communication with USAID's Administrator and involved US agribusiness with the USAID and university dialog.

The letter expressed the Council’s concern regarding persistent and new restrictions on investment in foreign markets, and what appears to be growing antagonism to foreign investment abroad motivated by protectionist or other reasons.  The Council believes that substantial and measurable progress can be achieved through the negotiation of comprehensive and binding bilateral investment treaties with each of the BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia, India and China).

At the April 8, 2008 meeting, the Council approved four letters of recommendation to the President.  The Council’s immigration reform letter focuses on specific immigration policies that the Council believes are necessary to ensure U.S. competitiveness in the 21st Century.  The provisions that should be addressed in any immigration reform legislation include exempting highly-skilled graduates from the green card cap, increasing employment-based visa quotas, and modernizing the visa programs to ensure talented workers can remain in the United States.  The Council’s letter regarding the importance of services in the Doha negotiations notes that the U.S. economy is heavily dependent on a strong services sector.  The letter states that your continuing efforts to ensure services receive the same level of attention as agriculture and Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA) will be critical to the successful conclusion of a Doha agreement that will garner the support of the largest and fastest-growing sector of the U.S. economy.  The Council’s letter addressing imported food and product safety states that information technology can improve the ability to expedite consumer notification of product recalls. To effectuate proper notice, the manufacturer/supplier must:  communicate with and give retailers notice of a product recall simultaneous to the notification of the regulatory authorities; provide retailers with precise information to enhance the rapid identification and removal of recalled products from the marketplace; and request retailers to institute a “stop sale” and block the sale of the product at the register.  The Council’s Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) letter states there is a need to develop an aggressive program designed to encourage and support our emerging SMEs to embrace the international market place.  To help SMEs pursue and compete in foreign markets, the Council recommends the Administration consider four strategies:  continue to pursue comprehensive trade agreements; encourage big businesses to use SMEs in their global supply chains; improve communication about U.S. Government programs to promote exports; and promote global recognition and use of standards and strong international rules.

On the June 25, 2008 conference call, the Council approved two letters of recommendation to the President and discussed the draft Final Report.  The Council’s letter regarding its fact-finding trip to Russia and Ukraine states that the countries exhibit a commercial environment which continues to be both challenging and extremely rewarding for American business.  The Council’s second letter, concerning the Environmental Goods and Services Agreement (EGSA), maintains that a strong agreement which eliminates tariffs and non-tariff barriers to key environmental technologies could yield widespread benefits around the globe and boost trade in these products by an additional 7 to 14 percent.  The Council also approved the content of the draft Final Report to the President.

The Advisory Committee recommends to the Secretary of Agriculture, that while acknowledging the importance of maintaining individual confidentiality, that NASS be granted access to the National Animal Identification System for the purpose of producing statistical data summaries.   

2.	The Advisory Committee recommends to the Secretary of Agriculture that NASS work in collaboration with other USDA agencies to establish more direct links to agricultural data contained in other USDA websites.

3.	The Advisory Committee recommends to the Secretary of Agriculture that NASS work with the Office of the General Counsel and the Office of the Chief Information Officer, to modify the required “Warning” notification on its Electronic Data Reporting website.  NASS should make the “Warning” notification more user friendly in an effort to ease farmers concerns in reporting electronically.

4.	The Advisory Committee recommends that NASS establish a phone number for to respondents to contact multilingual operators, – especially Spanish for assistance in reporting for the Census of Agriculture.  NASS should also develop questionnaires in other languages, and again especially Spanish.  Also, NASS needs to hire indigenous enumerators to conduct data collection on Indian reservations for the Census of Agriculture. 

5.	The Advisory Committee recommends that a subcommittee consisting of Gene Nelson, Terry Francl, Lucy Meyring, Ron Plain, and Kitty Smith, study the need and feasibility of a National Equine survey.   If the feasibility of conducting a National Equine survey is justified by this subcommittee, it will enhance NASS’s ability to seek appropriation funding. 

6.	The Advisory Committee recommends that NASS conduct more in-depth research concerning the new question on the Census of Agriculture asking for data on the acres operated on an Animal Unit Month (AUM).  The current members felt that the wording of the AUM question might be misunderstood by operators and result in misreported data. (This same AUM question has also been added to the Agricultural Resources Management Survey ARMS)

7.	The Advisory Committee recommends that a subcommittee consisting of Terry Francl, Frank Howell, Doris Mold, Janice Gengenbach, and Kent Schescke to research the feasibility of conducting an Energy survey.  With the raising cost of energy and the increased use of crops to generate new alternative fuels, the committee felt that the importance of this survey would be of more importance than an organic follow-on survey. 

8.	The Advisory Subcommittee on Pesticide Data Usage, after meeting and studying the scope of the NASS pesticide and chemical use program, recommended that no changes to the current NASS program are advised at this time and that the subcommittee be discontinued.  

9.	The Advisory Committee recommends that the priority needs for the 2007 Census of Agriculture follow-on surveys are 1) Census of Horticulture; 2) Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey; and 3) Economics and Land Ownership Survey.  

10.	The Advisory Committee recommends that NASS request that the Government Printing Office add the Census of Agriculture to the “Essential Titles for Public Use in Paper Format”, to ensure this media is available to all federal depository and research libraries.  

11.	The Advisory Committee recommends that NASS continue its efforts in working with Community Based Organizations and with the New Mexico pilot project on Indian reservations, to improve overall coverage of small and minority operated farms in the 2007 Census of Agriculture.

12.	The Advisory Committee recommends that NASS consider the use of outside promotional consultants and external support endorsements in development of the 2007 Census of Agriculture campaign to encourage producer cooperation.");

The American people are concerned about energy — its availability, reliability, cost, and environmental impact. Energy also has become a subject of urgent policy discussions. But energy is a complex subject, touching every part of daily life and the overall economy, involving a wide variety of technologies, and affecting many aspects of our foreign relations. The United States is the largest participant in the global energy system — the largest energy consumer, the second largest producer of coal and natural gas, and the largest importer and third largest producer of oil. Developing a framework for considering America’s oil and natural gas position now and for the future requires a broad view and a long-term perspective; both were provided in the Hard Truths study.");

The NGRAC, a statutory committee, was established in March 1992, under the USDA Departmental Regulation 1043-8 as directed by Section 1632 of P.L. 101-624 of the 1990 Farm Bill. Its charter was last renewed in March 1999 and expired in March 2001.  The NGRAC is appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture, and its duties are solely advisory to the Secretary and the Director of the National Genetic Resources Program (NGRP) on matters concerning the NGRP, established by the U.S. Congress to: acquire, characterize, preserve, document, and distribute to scientists germplasm of all life forms important for food and agricultural production. The NGRAC responds to the important issues of the nation in respect to conserving and utilizing genetic resources for food and agriculture. It meets twice a year, and can consist of up to nine members appointed by the Secretary and seven or more ex-officio members. Two-thirds of the appointed members represent the scientific disciplines relevant to NGRP, and one-third represent the general public in relevant activities. Thus, it is likely that each of the life forms in NGRP (plants, forest species, animals, aquatics, insects, and microbes) is represented by only one appointed scientific member.  The most recent meeting of the NGRAC was in August 1999 in Washington, D.C.Five new members were newly appointed in September 2000. The NGRAC’s most recent recommendations to the Department and the Program are included on its web page at http://www.ars-grin.gov/ngrac/

Currently, the NGRAC is inactive, pending rechartering.  New members must be appointed, or current members reappointed.  It would meet at least once, and perhaps twice, in 2004, likely in the mid-late spring, and early autumn. The agenda for such meeting would, of course, be strongly determined by the chair and members, but the following issue would likely merit high priority for discussion: 1) international genetic resource treaties and agreements, e.g., the International Treaty for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture; 2) review of USDA’s progress with acting on the previous NGRAC recommendation to the USDA and the NGRP to develop a road map (more explicit in relevant content than the broad Agricultural Research Service Six-Year Plan) and strategic plan for its genetic resources and genomics programs; 3) review of activities of other Advisory Committees, in particular those that deal with genetic resources, such as the ones on Agricultural Biotechnology and Invasive Species; 4) review of current budgets and fiscal status of USDA genetic resource programs; 5) review recent domestic and international developments associated with the application of intellectual property rights protection to plant genetic resources.");

Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee
2001-2007
Complete List of Recommendations and Statements (organized by Working Group)

PACA, Inspection Service and Market News:

Recommendation: The produce industry and the Market News Service should work together to educate industry members of the importance of providing accurate price and shipment information to the Market News Service.  This educational effort should include information on the process, how information is gathered, how the information is used, and the potential ramifications of inaccurate reports. (April 2003)

Recommendation: The PACA and the Inspection Service should develop a long-range plan to review and re-evaluate the Grade Standards for perishable agricultural commodities.  The process should involve members from all segments of the produce industry.  The review and possible revision of U.S. standards is necessary to incorporate modern industry practices and terminologies. (April 2003)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends that software and computer systems used by USDA and various state agencies to administer the Federal-State Inspection Program are compatible to increase efficiencies and decrease costs. (April 2002)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recognizes the value of the destination market inspection service. (April 2002)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee would like to commend AMS Fruit and Vegetable Programs for their quick progress on developing and implementing a long-range plan to review and re-evaluate U.S. grade standards for perishable agricultural commodities. (February 2004)

Recommendation: USDA should seek to educate the industry as to what is meant by the USDA grade stamp.  USDA should discourage the representation of anything more than what it represents. (July 2004)

Recommendation: Mindful that an effective Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA) is critical to the fruit and vegetable industry, the Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends the following changes to the PACA:

•	Consolidate license functions to one location; reduce field offices to three locations;
•	Evaluate development of a national call center as an industry resource;
•	Evaluate increasing the filing fee for informal and formal complaints;
•	Increase industry outreach and web resources; and
•	Evaluate the inclusion of a processing fee for single-year license renewals. (July 2004)
Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee strongly recommends a multiyear approach to addressing the revenue/cost gap that exists in the Fresh Products Branch’s terminal market inspection program, to recognize the impact on demand for services that significant price increases could have.  We commend recent and encourage future initiatives to hold down and reduce costs while maintaining the level of quality service needed by our industry. (July 2005)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends that the Department of Agriculture amend Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act regulations for the purpose of implementing a fee structure associated with industry members requesting PACA audits in connection with reparation complaints.  We propose that licensees pay $1,000 and non-licensees pay $3,000 per audit. (January 2007)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends to the Secretary of Agriculture that PACA license fees be raised in Fiscal Year 2010 so that the PACA Trust Fund will not fall below 25 percent of the program’s budget obligations before 2012. (January 2007)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends to the Secretary of Agriculture that PACA complaint filing fees be raised to $100 for informal complaints and $500 for formal complaints. (January 2007)
 
Farm Bill:

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee commends Secretary Johanns for his strong support of the fruit and vegetable industry.  The Committee further urges the Department’s support for provisions in the next Farm Bill that increase demand for fruits and vegetables, improve the health of Americans, and enhance the competitiveness of fruit and vegetable producers. (June 2006)

Recommendation: Recognizing the significant contributions the specialty crop industry makes to the American diet, U.S. agriculture, and the economies of the states in which they are produced, the Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee believes fruit and vegetable growers should receive equitable treatment in federal farm programs.  Accordingly, the Committee commends Secretary Johanns for his strong support of the fruit and vegetable industry and notes with interest the specific recommendations relating to specialty crops contained in USDA’s 2007 Farm Bill Proposals.  In addition to the Department’s recommendations, the Committee recommends that USDA consider the following:

•	Support the provisions of the EAT Healthy America Act (HR 1600) and the Specialty Crops Competition Act of 2007 (S 1160), which provide needed assistance to fruit and vegetable producers in critical areas such as conservation, international trade, pests and disease, nutrition, research, block grants to states, and renewable energy; and

•	Reconsider its position advocating the elimination of the fruit and vegetable planting restriction on program crop acres.  The removal of this important provision would place unsubsidized fruit and vegetable producers at a competitive disadvantage to subsidized program crop producers. (June 2007)
 
Domestic Fruit and Vegetable Nutrition, Consumption and Distribution:

Recommendation: We recommend that USDA define the current distribution channels for fresh fruits and vegetables and develop, in complete detail, the optimum scenario for delivering fresh fruits and vegetables to schools with the highest quality, maximum efficiency and cost effectiveness.

	AMS/State warehouses
	Department of Defense
	Fresh Local Level Direct Purchasing (April 2003)

Recommendation: We ask USDA to break down each of these three distribution models in a way that all costs of the supply chain are identified. Once completed, we ask USDA to present this information to the Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee, thus allowing the Committee to review and provide recommendations in regards to improving models. (April 2003)

Recommendation: We recommend USDA communicate and celebrate an educational program which promotes successful local school food service programs encompassing fresh fruit and vegetable offerings like the Best Practices program and less reliance on competitive foods. The three areas that define success:

	Better nutrition
	Cost effectiveness, self sufficient food service programs
	More fruit and vegetable offerings overall (April 2003)

Recommendation: We encourage USDA to review current allocations of funds to effectively provide the ultimate objective of increasing of fresh fruits and vegetables in schools, and expanding the four-state pilot program. (April 2003)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee strongly recommends USDA promote the increased consumption of fruits and vegetables as a method to achieve good eating habits and to help facilitate the fight against obesity/malnutrition in the United States. (April 2002)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends that the appropriations of USDA be reallocated to more closely mirror the value of fruits and vegetables and their role in the health of the American consumer. (April 2002)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee encourages the formulation of a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Education that would initiate a curriculum including exercise and complete nutrition information about the benefits of eating fruits and vegetables. (April 2002)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee applauds USDA for finalizing the Memorandum of Understanding related to and becoming an active participant in the 5-A-Day For Better Health Campaign. (April 2002)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee advocates a closer working relationship with the appropriate state agencies that would facilitate the effective deliveries of USDA-purchased fresh fruits and vegetables through state warehouses to food recipients. This could include pilot projects. (April 2002)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee supports the reconciliation of U.S.-Canada differences related to the use of the 5-A-Day For Better Health Program logo. (April 2002)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee would like USDA to supplement the Food Stamp Program with an incentive mechanism that would allow eligible persons to buy additional fruits and vegetables. (April 2002)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee urges the study of more efficient distribution systems for USDA commodity purchase programs. (February 2004)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends that USDA continue existing programs and develop additional initiatives that will focus on increasing consumption of all fruits and vegetables in recognition of the tremendous health benefits that a daily diet, which includes five to ten servings of highly nutritious fruit and vegetables, provides.  USDA and other federal agencies should collaborate in programs that will increase fruit and vegetable consumption to help combat chronic diseases, including obesity. (February 2004)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee supports the continuation of programs promoting consumption of all fruits and vegetables.  We urge USDA to continue the Fresh Pilot Program. (February 2004)

Recommendation: USDA should develop a centralized means to communicate via a smooth delivery system scientifically sound nutritional information from the various sources used to develop the Dietary Guidelines.  The focus should be on the importance of education as the key to promoting increased consumption of fruits and vegetables to fight obesity and promote healthy living. (July 2004)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee strongly encourages the enhancement of the USDA purchase programs with incentives to include more fruits and vegetables. (July 2004)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee commends USDA for the successful introduction of new dietary guidelines and encourages USDA to continue an ongoing publicity campaign to ensure continued awareness. (July 2005)
 
Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee strongly supports the addition of fruits and vegetables to Women, Infants and Children (WIC) food packages and commends USDA for addressing the need for change.  The Committee encourages continued nutrition education (i.e. MyPyramid.gov) as part of the program. (July 2005)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee strongly recommends that USDA follow the Dietary Guidelines in its education and implementation of nutrition assistance programs, such as school lunch, school breakfast, food stamps, and Women, Infants and Children (WIC). (June 2006)
 
Trade and Country of Origin:

Recommendation: USDA should be more specific in defining Country of Origin Labeling rules pertaining to the U.S. produce industry’s mandatory adherence to documentation requirements and violations; utilize familiar PACA rules to define Country of Origin Labeling requirements; and publish proposed final regulations in the Federal Register as soon as possible. (April 2003)

Recommendation: USDA should issue an opinion on the preservation of trust fund rights available under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA) of 1930 pertaining to electronic invoicing and a statement that USDA is in fact fulfilling buyers obligations in trust protection. (April 2003)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recommends that USDA, AMS continue its harmonization work with its counterparts in North America through the appropriate mechanism.  The immediate focus should be on implementing the following five harmonization initiatives which are essential elements of establishing a more positive business environment for produce trade across North America:

•	Development and implementation of a new destination market inspection service that builds on the USDA model in Canada;
•	Modernizing the licensing and arbitration regulations under the Canada Agriculture Products Act;
•	Development of an industry-lead strategy to reduce costly and disruptive practices in major markets in Canada;
•	Harmonization of Canadian and U.S. grade standards and inspection procedures; and
•	Development of a Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act-like trust in Canada. (January 2005)
 
Labor, Immigration and Crop Insurance:

Recommendation: The Secretary should send a letter to the White House endorsing the reform of H2A, the temporary foreign agricultural worker program, as proposed by Senator Craig and supported by the National Council of Agricultural Employers, and the earned adjustment status for the current agricultural workforce. (April 2003)

Recommendation: USDA is urged to fill the critically important position of special assistant for labor affairs with an expert in labor affairs. (April 2003)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee acknowledges the importance of agricultural labor in the production and distribution of agricultural commodities.  We would strongly support legislation that would provide a legal labor force for agricultural producers, including, but not limited to, immigration and H2A reform.  We also recognize the importance of the farmworker in our industry. (February 2004)

Recommendation: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee recognizes that federal crop insurance needs to offer products that have fair and equitable access to all farmers.  The Committee encourages the review of pilot programs to ensure that they do not create unequal opportunities within a commodity region. (July 2005)

Statement: The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee reaffirms the importance of agricultural labor in the production and distribution of agricultural commodities.  We would strongly support legislation that would provide a legal labor force for agricultural producers, including, but not limited to, immigration and H2A reform.  We also recognize the importance of the farmworker in our industry. (January 2007)
 
Food Safety, Third-Party Audits, Microbiological and Traceability:

Recommendation: USDA should either:

A. Increase funding of the Microbiological Data Program to generate information that will be useful in risk assessment to meet public health objectives; or
B. If");

After the second plenary meeting, three ad hoc working groups were established to develop information for the committee on future issues and concerns relating to three classes of biotechnology-derived products:   Group I-- crop (and transgenic terrestrial livestock animal) improvements; Group II-- quality improvements; and crop (and transgenic terrestrial livestock animal) specialty products.  The group members are:
Group I: Richard Crowder, Randal Giroux, Duane Grant, David Hoisington, Greg Jaffe, Keith Triebwasser, Lisa Zannoni.
Group II: Terry Medley, Margaret Mellon, Ronald Olson, Jerome Slocum.
Group III: Daryl Buss, Leon Corzine, Carole Cramer, Michael Dykes, Juan Enriquez-Cabot, Randal Giroux, David Magnus.

Following the December, 2003 plenary session, Work Groups were reorganized, with the following 3 new drafting groups:

Issues (that may arise over the next decade, for the 5-to-10 year perspective report):  Daryl Buss, Duane Grant, Michael Dykes, Greg Jaffe, Carole Cramer.

Scenarios for the future (for the 5-to-10 year perspective report):  Juan Enriquez, Jerry Slocum, Margaret Mellon, Terry Medley, Keith Triebwasser, Dave Hoisington.

A separate Traceability and Labeling Report:  Ron Olson, Randall Giroux, Greg Jaffe, Leon Corzine, Lisa Zannoni, Richard Crowder.


Work groups are open-ended, and any additional committee members may particiapte in work group discussions at their discretion.  Groups will meet in closed session via conference calls between plenary sessions, but all materials generated in those calls will be brought to plenary sessions for public discussion.

After her appointment to the AC21 in February, 2004, Carole Tucker Foreman joined the Issues Work Group.

Following the September, 2004, AC21 plenary session, the Issues Work Group was expanded to include all the members of the Traceability and Labeling Report group as well (that group continued to work on its other report also).

Two additional drafting Work Groups were also established at that time:

Definitions (for the 5-to-10 year perspective report):  Terry Medley, Carole Cramer, Randall Giroux

Introduction (for the 5-to-10 year perspective report):  Margaret Mellon, Richard Crowder, Michael Dykes, David Hoisington, Lisa Zannoni.

Please note that the AC21 decided at its February, 2005 meeting to turn the ""Scenarios"" chapter into a separate report (as part of the overall 5-to-10 year perspective charge to the committee) which was entitled, ""Preparing for the Future"" and which was submitted to the Secretary of Agriculture on May 9, 2005.

Following the August 9-10, 2005 plenary session, at which time members agreed to a significantly restructured format for the 5-to-10 year perspective report, existing work groups were viewed as no longer needed for completing the paper.  The committee was, however, divided into 3 (open-ended) groups who would meet via conference call for the purpose of drafting text on new topics discussed by the committee or reviewing Chair's draft text for the introductory portions (formal introduction plus the section on ""Realizing the Promise:  Opportunities and Challenges"") of the report.  The three groups were:  ""New Issues #1"": Michael Dykes, Robert Herdt, Ronald Olson, Margaret Mellon, Leon Corzine, Russell Kremer; ""New Topics #2"": Carol Tucker Foreman, Lisa Zannoni, Josephine Hunt, Duane Grant, Richard Crowder, Alison Van Eenennaam;  ""Introduction"":  Daryl Buss, Jerome Slocum, Gregory Jaffe, Bradley Shurdut, Randal Giroux, Carole Cramer,
Patricia Layton.

Following the 12th plenary session and with the substantial completion of another consensus report, a new work group was established to begin to help frame the committee's next project on the impacts of biotechnology coexistence considerations on agriculture and USDA for discussion by the full committee. (All previous work groups were no longer in existence). Members selected for this open-ended work group were Josephine Hunt, Leon Corzine, Michael Dykes, Russ Kremer, Mardi Mellon, and Nicholas Kalaitzandonakes.  This work was substantively completed at the seventeenth plenary session, on November 28-29, 2007, and at that meeting there was also a committee discussion about a new program under development at USDA's Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) called the Biotechnology Quality Management System, a voluntary system intended to help product developers improve compliance with APHIS rules and regulations.  (The fourth consensus paper prepared by the AC21 on coexistence was presented to the Office of the Secretary at the Committee's eighteenth plenary session on March 5-6, 2008.)

At the seventeenth plenary session, the committee began considering a series of presentations related to its next work project relating to the use of transgenic animals in agriculture. At the eighteenth plenary session, an ad hoc work group was assembled for a single session, consisting of Greg Jaffe, Alison Van Eenennaam, Jim Robl, Nancy Bryson, Randy Giroux, and Steve Leath to help frame the new charge for the AC21 related to transgenic animals into a useful outline.
Following the nineteenth plenary session on May 28-29, 2008, a series of drafting groups was assembled to develop preliminary text for the committee to consider at the following plenary.  These groups were:
Introduction--Guy Cardineau, Alison Van Eenennaam, Nancy Bryson, Steven Leath, Carol Tucker-Foreman
Safety Considerations--Greg Jaffe, Jamie Jonker, Pat Layton, Mike Engler, Fuller Bazer
Marketing Considerations--Brad Shurdut, Baryl Buss, Jerry Slocum, Russ Kremer, Jim Robl
Ethical Consideration--Mardi Mellon, Alison Van Eenennaam, Stephanie Whalen, Leon Corzine, Randy Giroux.
All groups were open to participation by any other interested members.
Texts developed by these groups were considered at the twentieth AC21 plenary session.  All of the above work groups were then dissolved, except that the Safety work group met once more to consider the need for revisions to the amended Safety text following announcements of new relevant regulatory policies or requests from information from the public from FDA and USDA's APHIS, respectively. 
Following the twentieth plenary session, on August 26-27, 2008, members agreed on the need to substantively revise and reorganize portions of the existing draft, and four new open-ended work groups were established as follows:
Setting the stage for ethical considerations--Alison Van Eenennaam, Mardi Mellon, Guy Cardineau, Daryl Buss, and Carol Tucker-Foreman
Mechanisms for considering ethical and other concerns-- Randy Giroux, Jim Robl, Carol Tucker-Foreman, Nancy Bryson, Leon Corzine
Trade/Imports/Market Access--Jamie Jonker, Greg Jaffe, Jerry Slocum, Steve Hensley, Stephanie Whalen
Pre-Commercialization Considerations--Brad Shurdut, Pat Layton, Russ Kremer, Fuller Bazer, Steven Leath.

The request, from Senate Report 110-107, is as follows: Senate--Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders- The Committee is concerned by the prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders [FASD] in the United States and notes that drinking during pregnancy is the Nation's leading known preventable cause of mental retardation and birth defects. To publicize and promote awareness of this critical public health information, the Committee has provided sufficient resources to continue these activities. The Committee notes that the National Task Force on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect is due to expire in October 2007. The Committee requests that the CDC submit a progress report within six months on the Task Force's contributions to preventing and reducing fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. The report should outline future plans for the Task Force, including programmatic and funding priorities. 

A Report to Congress entitled, Preventing and Reducing Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, was signed by the Director of CDC in August 2008 and forwarded to HHS. This report highlights CDC’s FASD-related prevention activities and future priorities (a separate Congressional request made in the House) in addition to describing the goals and accomplishments of the National Task Force on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect.

Part O, Section 399H(d)(1) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. Section 280f-3) directs the establishment of the National Task Force on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect. This legislation also includes a Sunset Provision (Section 399K) that reads “this part shall not apply on the date that is 7 years after the date on which all members of the National Task Force have been appointed under section 399H(d)(1).”
 
The initial appointments took effect October 24, 2000, therefore, the committee officially terminated October 25, 2007.

In responding to this charge, the Committee decided to re-review the four specific minority health priorities which they had previously selected to develop a recommendations: (1)Native American health (including ""indigenous"" peoples of the U.S. and the Pacific Islands), (2) educational outreach and health promotion, (3) the role of information technology in health care, and (4)impact issues.  Because of its small membership size the Committee decided to develop a recommendation report per health topic/priority area to address existing health disparities that impact racial and ethnic minorities; rather than to work on developing four recommendation reports simultaneously. Consequently, the four subcommittees were dissolved and team leader was decided from amongst its membership to take the lead in developing a recommendation report. The Committee drafted a recommendation report on reducing health disparities by promoting patient-centered culturally and linguistically sensitive/competent health care that is pending appropriate review within the Department.

• Over 5 million Americans earned a presidential recognition award in FY 2008. • Over 30 thousand schools participated in the President’s Challenge program, and 108 State Champion Schools were honored and selected. • Since the launch of the interactive program Web site in July 2003, (www.presidentschallenge.org), over 3 million unique visitors have been on the site, and over 600,000 individuals have signed up for the President’s Challenge online to track their physical activity.• Presented 2008 Lifetime Achievement Award and 27 Community Leadership Awards• Efforts were continued with state and territorial governors through the HHS Regional Directors, generating increased interest in PCPFS programs and information resources. • PCPFS produced three Research Digests, which translate the latest research on a high interest topic in the area of physical activity and sports medicine for health/fitness professionals and other interested citizens. • PCPFS continued distribution Rx -- Physical Activity: Take the President’s Challenge, with the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE). • Over 200 partnerships have been formed with corporations and organizations that are implementing the President’s Challenge program at the grassroots and/or national level. • Partnerships include: 1) “I Can Do It, You Can Do It ”, an initiative with the HHS Office on Disability, which uses the President’s Challenge Physical Activity and Fitness Awards program and pairs mentors with children with disabilities to encourage and increase their physical activity. Mentors provide guidance and instruction to youth with disabilities as they become and stay physically active.; 2) The CHEER Challenge with the Harlem Globetrotters and the Department of Education to promote the benefits of physical activity and character education to youth. 3) General Mills supports the President's Challenge Program in low SES schools; 4) HealthierUS Veterans with the Dept of VA to promote the benefits of healthy lifestyles to veterans and their families. The PCPFS Science Board continued its work after initially being formed in ‘03 to review publications, offer feedback re: sports/physical activity clinics, and to serve as science experts for PCPFS publications and programs, including the Adult Fitness Test. Ten renowned exercise scientists serve on this Board. • One new science partnership was formed with the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine, adding to partnerships with the American Physical Therapy Association, American Heart Association, American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), National Strength & Conditioning Association (NSCA), National Athletic Trainers Association (NATA), and American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation & Dance Research Consortium, totaling seven science partnerships. • PCPFS promoted outdoor recreation on public lands in conjunction with a Federal Interagency Work Group (the Public Health and Recreation MOU: HHS, DOI; USDA Forest Service; Army Corps of Engineers, and DOT). A document ""Call to Activity"" was developed to show the connection between public lands and public health. 
All recommendations have been fully implemented with success. 1. The inaugural National President's Challenge was implemented from March 20 - May 15, 2008. Close to 90,000 people from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and several U.S. territories participated. Top five winners: Alaska, Arkansas, Wyoming, D.C., Maryland. 2. The Adult Fitness Test was launched on May 14, 2008 during National Physical Fitness and Sports Month. This on-line interactive tool is free to the public. 75,000 people took the on-line test in the first week of the launch. Over 104,000 people took the test in FY08. 3. The President’s Challenge Web site continues to grow in # of participants, and advanced features have been added. 4. Over 200 partnerships are now formed with corporations and organizations that are implementing the President’s Challenge program and raising the awareness of physical activity benefits nationally. 5. One new science partnership was formed with the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine, adding to partnerships with the American Physical Therapy Association, American Heart Association, American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), National Strength & Conditioning Association (NSCA), National Athletic Trainers Association (NATA), and American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation & Dance Research Consortium, totaling seven partnerships. 6.

Eight reports have been issued as a result; another four reports will soon be published (as of October 2008) and an additional two inquiries are underway and will likely culminate in the issuance of white papers in early 2009.  

The Council may initiate an inquiry, gather information and data through expert presentations, seek to clarify the ethical questions (especially those of relevance to the need for public education and for policy formation by the President and/or U.S. Congress), and yet conclude that these questions are such that the Council has no unique contribution to make to debate ""in the public square.""  Or, it may decide that it does have a unique contribution to make and thus should devote the requisite staff resources (and Council effort) to an inquiry that will issue in a report to the President and the public.  With any one of these potential results, the process is neither ""quick"" nor superficial.

Of the topics we have pursued thus far, the Council ultimately decided not to move forward to the issuance of a report on such topics as the ethics of clinical research, children and bioethics, neuroethics, and the crisis of the health professions.  With the topic of nanotechnology, although the Council decided not to pursue and issue a comprehensive report, it did publish a memorandum summarizing its findings and its conclusion that this topic does, indeed, merit close monitoring and ongoing inquiry as its consequences and implications become more clear—and, perhaps, worthy of a more in-depth treatment.  Moreover, as noted elsewhere in this report, four reports will soon be published (on organ transplantation, standards for the determination of death, health care reform, and newborn screening).  

The process of moving forward with an inquiry that will issue in a report usually entails additional research, staff drafting of the text, and then the distribution of the draft text to selected experts in the field, prior to finalizing the text.  This process has been implemented in an effort to ensure that the ultimate product of our work is conceptually sound, empirically/factually correct, and of the best quality possible to present to the President, and consequently for dissemination to members of the U.S. Congress and the general public.

Finally, with respect to stem cell research, the Council held a session on this topic in November 2006 and may hold another in early 2009.  Meanwhile, the Council Chairman, Dr. Edmund Pellegrino, has continued to consult with the President on recent legislative activity in this topic area, thus fulfilling the first and foremost mission of the Council, to advise the President on advances in biotechnology, biomedicine and biomedical research.");

Section V.d. of the Council's Charter requires that the Council report to the Department of State's Under Secretary for Management through the Council's Executive Secretary and specifies that the reporting method may be ""oral and/or written"".  The Council complies with this requirement through briefings on Council activities, issues, and recommendations, which the Executive Secretary provides approximately once a month  to the Department's Assistant Secretary for Administration.  The Assistant Secretary in turn reports the substance of these briefings to the Under Secretary for Management.  In addition, the Executive Secretary provides brief written summaries on each Council Annual and Executive Committee Meeting and other significant activities for inclusion in the Bureau of Administration's  Weekly Activity Report,which the Bureau provides to the Under Secretary for Management.  For example, the Executive Secretary submitted written reports on the participation of an American overseas school in the Johnson & Johnson-sponsored summer training institute on drug & alcohol abuse prevention at Rutgers University in July 2008 and OSAC's sponsorship of two projects to address special educational needs of students in American overseas schools.   The first of these was the Council project, ""Making the Difference:Differentiation in International Schools"".  This project provides a training manual for teachers in how to assess and differentiate the educational needs of students in multi-cultural and multi-lingual classrooms.  The Executive Secretary reported the  manual has proven so popular with the 194 American overseas schools that it is has been printed several times.  The second of these special needs projects was ""Parent Advocacy in International Schools"".  This handbook provides guidance for parents in how to work more effectively with teachers and administrators to meet the educational needs of their children who are students in American overseas schools.  The Executive Secretary reported that the reception of this project has been excellent, and many of the schools have asked the Council to provide a copy for all parents and teachers. 

Item 18 Costs.  The differences between the cost estimates in this annual report and the cost estimate in the annual report for 2007 reflects the Federal cost of living and locality adjustments provided to FTE and similar cost of living adjustments provided to contractor personnel, which support the Council.  In addition the differences reflect the conversion of a part-time contractor position to an FTE that works part-time on Council matters.

While the Council has no subcommittees per se, it does have an Evaluation Committee, composed of four members that the Council Chair appoints.  The membership of the Evaluation Committee includes the Council Chair, at least one of the Vice Chairs, and two other Council members.  The Evaluation Committee reviews educational improvement/enhancement proposals for American overseas schools, which the Overseas Schools Regional Associations submit for Council sponsorship.  After completing these reviews, the Evaluation Committee makes recommendations on the proposals to the full Council for consideration.  The full Council then accepts, rejects, modifies, or defers  the Evaluation Committee's recommendations.  In addition the Council has established an ad-hoc committee on fundraising.

In the past year the website has generated over 16,300 daily news articles, hot topics, crime and safety reports, and other security related issues used by the private sector in order to make decisions when coping in a foreign environment.
