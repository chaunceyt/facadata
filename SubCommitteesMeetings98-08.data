George Collins made the motion that Amite County’s AC 1 proposal be approved and be made the priority proposal.  Harold Dillon seconded the motion - Discussions followed - motion carried.

Steve Oglesby made the motion that FC 1; FC 2; AC 2; and USFS 1 proposals be approved and be made priorities in that order.  George Collins seconded the motion – Discussions followed -motion carried.
